        <summary>JS Introduction</summary>
        <pre>
        JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development,It is used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities


        JavaScript was created in May 1995 in 10 days, by Brendan Eich. Eich worked at Netscape and implemented JavaScript for their web browser, Netscape Navigator.Initially, JavaScript’s name changed several times:
        
        Its code name was Mocha.
        In the Netscape Navigator 2.0 betas (September 1995), it was called LiveScript.
        In Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 (December 1995), it got its final name, JavaScript.
        Why Javascript..?
        All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
        JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
        JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
        JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
        It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
        Standardizing JavaScript ECMA
        ECMA-262 is hosted by Ecma International. It is the primary standard
        
        The language described by these standards is called ECMAScript, not JavaScript. A different name was chosen because Sun (now Oracle) had a trademark for the latter name. The "ECMA" in "ECMAScript" comes from the organization that hosts the primary standard.
        
        The original name of that organization was ECMA, an acronym for European Computer Manufacturers Association. It was later changed to Ecma International (with "Ecma" being a proper name, not an acronym) because the organization’s activities had expanded beyond Europe. The initial all-caps acronym explains the spelling of ECMAScript
        
        In principle, JavaScript and ECMAScript mean the same thing. Sometimes the following distinction is made:
        
        The term JavaScript refers to the language and its implementations.
        The term ECMAScript refers to the language standard and language versions. Therefore, ECMAScript 6 is a version of the language (its 6th edition).
        Edition	Date of Published	Name	Description
        1	June 1997	ECMAScript 1	First version of the standard
        2	June 1998	ECMAScript 2	Small update to keep ECMA-262 in sync with the ISO standard.
        3	December 1999	ECMAScript 3	Adds many core features – regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements [do-while, switch], try/catch exception handling
        4	June 2003	ECMAScript 4	(abandoned in July 2008): Would have been a massive upgrade (with static typing, modules, namespaces, and more), but ended up being too ambitious and dividing the language’s stewards.
        5	December 2009	ECMAScript 5	Brought minor improvements – a few standard library features and strict mode.
        5.1	June 2011	ECMAScript 5.1	Another small update to keep Ecma and ISO standards in sync
        6	June 2015	ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015)	A large update that fulfilled many of the promises of ECMAScript 4. This version is the first one whose official name – ECMAScript 2015
        7	June 2016	ECMAScript 2016 (ES2016)	First yearly release. The shorter release life cycle resulted in fewer new features compared to the large ES6.
        8	June 2017	ECMAScript 2017 (ES2017)	Second yearly release.
        9	June 2018	ECMAScript 2018 (ES2018)	New features include the spread operator and rest parameters (...) for object literals, asynchronous iteration, Promise.prototype.finally and additions to RegExp.
        10	June 2019	ECMAScript 2019 (ES2019)	Added features include, but are not limited to, Array.prototype.flat, Array.prototype.flatMap, changes to Array.sort and Object.fromEntries
        11	June 2020	ECMAScript 2020 (ES2020)	In addition to new functions, this version introduces a BigInt primitive type for arbitrary-sized integers, the nullish coalescing operator, and the globalThis object.
        12	June 2021	ECMAScript 2021 (ES2021)	This version introduces the replaceAll method for strings,Promise.any,AggregateError,logical assignment operators (??=, &&=, ||=), WeakRef,FinalizationRegistry,separators for numeric literals,Array.prototype.sort

            In this simple program that prints "Tutor Joe's" on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.

            In JavaScript, you can use the alert() function to display an alert box with a message to the user. The basic syntax for the alert() function is as follows:
            
            Source Code
           
    
                    alert("Tutor Joes");
              
            
            This will display an alert box with the message "Tutor Joes" and an OK button that the user must click to close the alert box.You can also use the prompt() function to display an input box and get input from the user.

        <summary>Mastering the JavaScript Console: Tips and Tricks for Debugging and Development
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console. We can open a console in web browser. The console object provides us with several different methods :

log()
error()
warn()
clear()
time() and timeEnd()
table()
count()
custom console logs
The JavaScript console is a built-in object in the browser that provides access to the browser's developer console. The developer console is a tool that allows developers to view and debug their code, as well as run JavaScript commands directly in the browser. The console object provides a number of methods for logging information to the console, such as console.log(), console.info(), console.warn(), and console.error(). These methods can be used to output data to the console, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the behavior of a JavaScript application. Additionally, the console object also provides methods for measuring performance, such as console.time() and console.timeEnd(), and for grouping and collapsing output in the console using console.group() and console.groupEnd().

script.js
//alert("Welcome to Js for External File");
 
console.log("Welcome To Tutor Joes");
console.log(123456);
console.log(18.25);
console.log(true);
console.log([58,78,96,35]);
console.log({fname:'Joes',age:25});
console.table({fname:'Joes',age:25});
console.error("Custom Sample Error");
console.warn("Custom Sample Error");
console.clear();
console.time("Timer");
for(i=0;i10;i++)
{
  console.log(i);
}
console.timeEnd("Timer");

        <summary>Understanding the Differences Between var, let, and const in JavaScript
            :</summary>
        <pre>
            One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration.

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
var
Variable means anything that can vary. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.

Use the reserved keyword var to declare a variable in JavaScript.

let
let cannot be Redeclared.
let must be Declared before use.
let have Block Scope.
const
const cannot be Redeclared.
const cannot be Reassigned.
const have Block Scope.

        <summary>Exploring the Various Data Types in JavaScript: From Primitives to Objects
        </summary>
        <pre>
     
            Data types in JavaScript describe the different types or kinds of data that you will be working with and storing in variables. It's important that you learn each of these data types because otherwise data can get stored in an improper format which will result in issues in your code later on.n JavaScript, data types are used to classify different types of data and define the type of values that a variable can hold. The main data types in JavaScript include:

            Primitive data types: These are the basic data types that include numbers, strings, booleans, and special values like null and undefined.
            
            Data Type	Description

            String	=>A string is a collection of alphanumeric characters.
            Number	=>Numbers are for numbers. We can't put a letter on here.
            Boolean	=>Booleans have two values. True and false.
            Null and Undefined=>null and undefined stand for empty. That means they have no value assigned to them.
            Symbols	=>Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript.It's a very peculiar data type. Once you create a symbol, its value is kept private and for internal use.
            Array	An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.
            Object => Literals	It is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.
            Date	=>JavaScript does not have a date data type. However, you can use the Date object and its methods to work with dates and times in your applications.
            JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that the data type of a variable does not have to be explicitly declared. Instead, JavaScript automatically determines the data type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. However, it's a good practice to be aware of the data types in JavaScript as you work with variables and write your code.
            
            In addition to these basic data types, JavaScript also has some special data types like Symbol and bigInt, which are used for specific purposes.

        <summary>Type Conversion in JavaScript: How to Convert and Cast Data Types
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, type conversion is the process of changing the data type of a variable or a value. This can be done using various built-in functions and methods.

Few Examples of Type Conversion
Strings to Numbers
Numbers to Strings
Dates to Numbers
Numbers to Dates
Boolean to Numbers
Numbers to Boolean
Type conversion Methods

String(value) : Converts the given value to a string.
Number(value) : Converts the given value to a number.
Boolean(value) : Converts the given value to a boolean.
parseInt(value) : Converts the given value to an integer.
parseFloat(value) : Converts the given value to a floating-point number.
JavaScript also has some unary operators that perform type conversion

+value : Converts the given value to a number.
-value : Converts the given value to a number.
!value : Converts the given value to a boolean.
It is also possible to convert a value to a different type using the valueOf() and toString() methods.

JavaScript also has some automatic type coercion which happens when different types are being used together in an operation. For instance, if a string is added to a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number before performing the addition.

It's important to keep in mind that type conversion can lead to unexpected results if not handled properly.


script.js
//Type Conversion
 
let a;
//Others to String
a=25;
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=String(25);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a=25.5;
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=String(25.5);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a=true;
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=String(true);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a=new Date();
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=String(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=String(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
 
a=25
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=a.toString();
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
 
//String to number
a="1234"
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=Number(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a=true;
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=Number(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a=[1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=Number(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
 
a="Tutor Joes";
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=Number(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a='35';
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=parseInt(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a='35.55';
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=parseInt(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);
 
a='35.55';
console.log(a,typeof a);
a=parseFloat(a);
console.log(a,typeof a);

        <summary>Uncovering the Mysteries of Type Coercion in JavaScript </summary>
        <pre>
            Type Coercion refers to the process of automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. This includes conversion from Number to String, String to Number, Boolean to Number etc. when different types of operators are applied to the values.

Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another automatically. This happens when different data types are used in the same operation or when a value is compared to a value of a different data type.

For example, when a string is added to a number, JavaScript will automatically convert the string to a number before performing the addition. Similarly, when a non-boolean value is used in a boolean context, JavaScript will convert the value to a boolean using a set of rules.

JavaScript uses a set of rules to determine the type of a value when performing type coercion, these rules are called type coercion rules. For example, in JavaScript empty string, 0, null, undefined, NaN are considered as falsy values, and all other values are considered as truthy.

Type coercion can also occur when comparing values of different data types. For example, when comparing a string to a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number before making the comparison.

It's important to be aware of type coercion when writing JavaScript code, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly. To avoid type coercion issues, it's best practice to explicitly convert the data types when necessary.
script.js
//Type Coercion
 
let a="25";
let b=10;
 
console.log(a+b);
 
 a=Number("25");
 b=10;
 
console.log(a+b);

        <summary>Performing Arithmetic Operations in JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, arithmetic operations are used to perform mathematical calculations and manipulate numerical values. The basic arithmetic operations include

Sno	Operator	Usage
1.	+	Addition
2.	-	Subtraction
3.	*	Multiplication
4.	**	Exponentiation (2016)
5.	/	Division
6.	%	Modulus (Remainder)
7.	++	Increment
8.	--	Decrement
Addition (+): This operator is used to add two or more numbers together. For example, 4 + 3 will give the result of 7.
Subtraction (-): This operator is used to subtract one number from another. For example, 10 - 3 will give the result of 7.
Multiplication (*): This operator is used to multiply two or more numbers together. For example,4 * 3 will give the result of 12.
Division (/): This operator is used to divide one number by another. For example, 10 / 5 will give the result of 2
Modulus (%): This operator is used to find the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, 10 % 3 will give the result of 1.
Exponentiation (**): This operator is used to raise a number to a certain power. For example, 2 ** 4 will give the result of 16.

script.js
//Arithmetic Operation
let a=100;
let b=20;
let c;
c=a+b;
c=a-b;
c=a*b;
c=a/b;
c=a%b;
c=2**3;//2016
c=++a;
c=--b;
console.log(c);

The above code is written in JavaScript and it performs various arithmetic operations on two variables, a and b. The variables a and b are declared using the let keyword and are assigned the values 100 and 20, respectively.

A new variable c is declared using the let keyword and is used to store the result of the arithmetic operations.

The first operation is the addition of a and b and the result is assigned to c. Then the subtraction of b from a and the result is assigned to c. Then the multiplication of a and b and the result is assigned to c. Then the division of a by b and the result is assigned to c. Then the modulus of a by b and the result is assigned to c.

Then the operation 2 raised to the power of 3, which gives the result 8. Then the operation of incrementing the value of a and the result is assigned to c. Then the operation of decrementing the value of b and the result is assigned to c.

Finally, the console.log() function is used to output the final value of c to the console, which will be the result of the last operation performed, which is decrementing the value of b.

        <summary>Understanding the Power of Shorthand Assignment Operators in JavaScript:</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is the "=" sign, which assigns the value on the right side of the operator to the variable on the left side. There are also several shorthand assignment operators that can be used to perform an operation and assignment in one step. These include

Sno	Operator	Usage
1.	=	Assigns a value
2.	+=	Adds a value to a variable.
3.	-=	Subtracts a value from a variable.
4.	*=	Multiplies a variable.
5.	/=	Divides a variable.
6.	%=	Assigns a remainder to a variable.
Addition assignment (+=): adds the right-side value to the left-side variable and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
Subtraction assignment (-=): subtracts the right-side value from the left-side variable and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
Multiplication assignment (*=): multiplies the left-side variable by the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
Division assignment (/=): divides the left-side variable by the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
Modulus assignment (%=): finds the remainder when the left-side variable is divided by the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
Exponentiation assignment (**=): raises the left-side variable to the power of the right-side value and assigns the result to the left-side variable.
It's important to note that these shorthand assignment operators only work with variables, they can not be used with literals. Additionally, the shorthand assignment operators follow the order of precedence of the mathematical operation they are performing.

Another important point is that you should be careful about using the assignment operator within the conditional statements because it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly.
This code uses the shorthand assignment operators to perform arithmetic operations and assignment in one step.

The first line declares a variable a with the value of 10.
The next line uses the "+=" shorthand operator to add 5 to the current value of a and assigns the result back to a. This is equivalent to writing a = a + 5; and the value of a will be 15.
The next line uses the "-=" shorthand operator to subtract 5 from the current value of a and assigns the result back to a. The value of a will be 10.
The next line uses the "*=" shorthand operator to multiply the current value of a by 5 and assigns the result back to a. The value of a will be 50.
The next line uses the "/=" shorthand operator to divide the current value of a by 5 and assigns the result back to a. The value of a will be 10.
The next line uses the "%=" shorthand operator to finds the remainder when the current value of a is divided by 5 and assigns the result back to a. The value of a will be 0.
Finally, the console.log(a) statement is used to display the value of a on the console, which is 0.
script.js
//Assignment Operators
let a=10;
 
//a=a+5; //+=
a+=5;//15
a-=5;//10
a*=5;//50
a/=5;//50
a%=5;//0
console.log(a);

So the final value of a will be 0, because all the operation are performed on the value of a and the last operation is a%=5 which returns the remainder of a divided by 5 which is 0.

        <summary>Unleashing the Power of JavaScript Math Object: A Comprehensive Guide</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript provides a built-in Math object that contains various mathematical functions and constants that can be used in your code. Some of the commonly used mathematical functions in JavaScript are

PI	E	round	floor	ceil
sqrt	abs	trunc (Return Integer only)	pow	min
max	random	random	sign	sin
cos	log	log2	log10	
Math.abs(x): returns the absolute value of x, which is the non-negative value of x without any sign.
Math.ceil(x): rounds the number x up to the nearest integer.
Math.floor(x): rounds the number x down to the nearest integer.
Math.round(x): rounds the number x to the nearest integer.
Math.sqrt(x): returns the square root of x.
Math.pow(x, y): returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
Math.max(x1, x2, ...): returns the largest of zero or more numbers.
Math.min(x1, x2, ...): returns the smallest of zero or more numbers.
Math.random(): returns a random number between 0 and 1.
Math.sin(x): returns the sine of x (x is in radians).
Math.cos(x): returns the cosine of x (x is in radians).
Math.tan(x): returns the tangent of an angle x (x is in radians).
Math.log(x): returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.
Math.log10(x): returns the common logarithm (base 10) of x.
Math.exp(x): returns the value of Ex.
The Math object also provides some mathematical constants like Math.PI, Math.E and Math.LN2, Math.LN10, Math.LOG2E, Math.LOG10E etc.

It's important to note that the Math object is a static object, which means that you do not need to create an instance of the object in order to use.

This code demonstrates the use of the built-in Math object in JavaScript, which provides various mathematical functions and constants that can be used in your code.

The first line assigns the value of PI to the variable c using the Math.PI constant.
The next line assigns the value of E to the variable c using the Math.E constant.
The next line uses the Math.round() function to round the number 5.8 to the nearest integer, which is 6. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.floor() function to round the number 5.58 down to the nearest integer, which is 5. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.ceil() function to round the number 5.58 up to the nearest integer, which is 6. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.sqrt() function to find the square root of 90, which is 9.486832980505138. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.abs() function to find the absolute value of -45, which is 45. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.trunc() function to truncate the number 4.9 and returns the integer part, which is 4. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.pow() function to find the power of 2 raised to 4, which is 16. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.min() function to find the minimum number among 10, 50, 5, 45, and 8, which is 5. The result is assigned to the variable c.
The next line uses the Math.max() function to find the maximum

        <summary>Mastering Comparison Operators in JavaScript: Equality, Relational, and Logical</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false) depending on the result of the comparison. The basic comparison operators include

Equality (==): This operator compares two values to see if they are equal.

Inequality (!=): This operator compares two values to see if they are not equal.

=== operator, on the other hand, is a strict equality operator and does not perform type coercion. It will only return true if the values being compared have the same type and value.

Sno	Operator	Usage
1.	==	equal to
2.	===	equal value and equal type
3.	!=	not equal
4.	!==	not equal value or not equal type


The first console.log statement will output false because the == operator compares the values of the variables, and 10 is not equal to "25".

The second console.log statement will output false as well because the === operator compares the values and types of the variables, and 10 is not equal to "25" in both value and type.

The third console.log statement will output true because the != operator returns the opposite of the == operator, so 10 is not equal to "25".

The fourth console.log statement will output true as well because the !== operator returns the opposite of the === operator, so 10 is not equal to "25" in both value and type.

script.js
//Comparison Operators
 
let a=10;
let b="25";
console.log(a==b);
console.log(a===b);
console.log(a!=b);
console.log(a!==b);

        <summary>Exploring the World of Relational Operators in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, there are several relational operators that can be used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. When using these operators, the expressions on either side of the operator will be evaluated and compared to determine if the relationship between them is true or false

Sno	Operator	Usage
1.	>	greater than
<!-- 2.	<	less than -->
3.	>=	greater than or equal to
<!-- 4.	<=	less than or equal to -->
Greater than (>): This operator compares two values and returns true if the left-side value is greater than the right-side value and false if it is not.

<!-- Less than (<): This operator compares two values and returns true if the left-side value is less than the right-side value and false if it is not. -->

Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator is used to compare two values and determine if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value. If the first value is greater than or equal to the second value, the operator returns true. If the first value is less than the second value, the operator returns false.

<!-- Less than or equal to (<=): This operator is used to compare two values and determine if the first value is less than or equal to the second value. If the first value is less than or equal to the second value, the operator returns true. If the first value is greater than the second value, the operator returns false. -->


The first console.log statement will output "Greater : false" because the value of a is not greater than the value of b.

The second console.log statement will output "Lesser : true" because the value of a is less than the value of b.

The third console.log statement will output "Greater Than Equal : false" because the value of a is not greater than or equal to the value of b.

The fourth console.log statement will output "Greater Than Equal : true" because the value of a is less than or equal to the value of b.

script.js
//Relational Operators in JavaScript
 
/*
>	greater than
<!-- <	less than -->
>=	greater than or equal to
<!-- <=	less than or equal to -->
*/
 
let a=10;
let b=20;
 
console.log("Greater : ",a>b);
<!-- console.log("Lesser  : ",a<b); -->
console.log("Greater Than Equal  : ",a>=b);
<!-- console.log("Greater Than Equal  : ",a<=b); -->

        <summary>Logical Operators in JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, there are several logical operators that can be used to combine and evaluate multiple expressions. These operators include:

Sno	Operator	Usage
1.	&&	and
2.	||	or
3.	!	not
The && operator compares two expressions and returns true only if both expressions are true. The || operator compares two expressions and returns true if either or both expressions are true. The ! operator negates the value of a single expression, so if the expression is true, it returns false and if the expression is false, it returns true.

The Below code uses logical operators in JavaScript to perform different comparisons and return a Boolean value (true or false).

The first line of code uses the logical and operator (&&) to check if the value of the variable mark is greater than or equal to 35 and less than or equal to 100. The && operator checks if both conditions are true, and if so, returns true. In this case, since 45 is greater than or equal to 35 and less than or equal to 100, the console will log true.

The second line of code uses the logical or operator (||) to check if the value of the variable a is equal to 2 or equal to 5. The || operator checks if either of the conditions are true, and if so, returns true. In this case, since 5 is equal to 5, the console will log true.

The last line of code uses the logical not operator (!) to check the opposite of the value of the variable a. The ! operator inverts the Boolean value of the variable, so if a is false, the console will log true.

script.js
//Logical Operators in JavaScript 
/*
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	  logical not
*/
//35-100
let mark=45;
 
<!-- console.log(mark>=35 && mark<=100); -->
 
let a=5;
//2,5
console.log(a==2 || a==5);
 
a=false;
console.log(!a);
</pre>

      <summary>Strict Equality or Identity Operators in JavaScript </summary>
      <pre>
        In JavaScript, identity operators are used to compare the equality of two values while also considering their data types. There are two identity operators:

Strict Equality Operator (===)
The strict equality operator (===) checks for equality between two values while considering both their values and data types. It returns true if both the values and data types are identical, and false otherwise
Equality Operator (==)
The equality operator (==) also checks for equality between two values, but it performs type coercion if the data types are different. It tries to convert one or both operands to the same type before making the comparison.

      <pre>
        Ternary operators in JavaScript provide a concise way to write conditional statements. The ternary operator is also known as the conditional operator, and it allows you to evaluate a condition and return one of two expressions based on whether the condition is true or false.

Syntax

             condition ? expression1 : expression2;

The condition is evaluated.
If the condition is true, the value of expression1 is returned.
If the condition is false, the value of expression2 is returned.

      <summary>Bitwise Operators in JavaScript </summary>
      <pre>
        Bitwise operators in JavaScript are used to manipulate the individual bits of integer values at the binary level. These operators perform bit-level operations on the binary representations of the values. Bitwise operations are commonly used in low-level programming, cryptography, and certain optimization techniques.

        Sno	Operator	Usage
        1.	Bitwise AND (&)	Bitwise AND assignment (&=)
        2.	Bitwise OR (|)	Bitwise OR assignment (|=)
        3.	Bitwise NOT (~)	
        4.	Bitwise XOR (^)	Bitwise XOR assignment (^=)
        <!-- 5.	Left shift (<<)	Left shift assignment (<<=) -->
        6.	Right shift (>>)	Right shift assignment (>>=)

        Nullish Coalescing Operator is a relatively new addition to JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11). It provides a concise way to handle default values when dealing with null or undefined values.

The nullish coalescing operator is represented by ??, and it returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is either null or undefined. Otherwise, it returns the left-hand operand.

Syntax

             const result = leftOperand ?? rightOperand;

      <summary>Increment or Decrement Operators in JavaScript</summary>
      <pre>
        The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators in JavaScript are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively. They are unary operators, meaning they work on a single operand. The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators can be used in two forms: postfix and prefix. The difference lies in when the increment or decrement operation takes place in relation to the variable.

Postfix Increment / Decrement (x++ / x--)
The postfix increment (x++) and postfix decrement (x--) operators first return the original value of the variable and then increment or decrement the variable by 1.
Prefix Increment / Decrement (++x / --x)
The prefix increment (++x) and prefix decrement (--x) operators first increment or decrement the variable by 1 and then return the updated value.

      <summary>If Statement in JavaScript</summary>
      <pre>
        The "if" statement is used to make decisions based on the evaluation of a condition. It allows you to execute a block of code if a given condition is true. If the condition is false, the code inside the "if" block is skipped, and the program continues with the next statement after the "if" block.

Syntax :
         if (condition)
         {
                   // Code to be executed if the condition is true
         }

The "condition" is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (true or false). If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces {} is executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the "if" block is skipped.

        In JavaScript, a "do-while" loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is similar to the "while" loop, but with one key difference: the "do-while" loop guarantees that the code inside the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is false from the beginning.

      <summary>For Loop in JavaScript</summary>
      <pre>
        In JavaScript, a "for" loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specific number of iterations. It is one of the most commonly used loops and is particularly useful when the number of iterations is known or when you want to iterate over elements in an array or other data structures.

Syntax:
       for (initialization; condition; update) {
           // Code to be executed for each iteration
       }

Here's the breakdown of each part of the "for" loop:

Initialization: This part is executed once before the loop starts. It is typically used to initialize a loop control variable.
Condition: The loop continues as long as the condition is true. Before each iteration, the condition is evaluated. If the condition is false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.
Update: This part is executed after each iteration of the loop. It is typically used to update the loop control variable.

        In JavaScript, you can loop over objects by converting them into an array of key-value pairs using various methods. Once the object is converted into an array, you can use standard array iteration methods like "for...of" loop, "forEach" method, or other array iteration techniques to access and process the key-value pairs.

        <summary>Mastering String Functions in JavaScript: Tips and Tricks</summary>
        <pre>
            String functions are used in computer programming languages to manipulate a string or query information about a string (some do both). Most programming languages that have a string datatype will have some string functions although there may be other low-level ways within each language to handle strings directly.JavaScript has many built-in string functions that can be used to manipulate strings. Some common string functions include

length: returns the number of characters in a string
toUpperCase(): returns the string in all uppercase letters
toLowerCase(): returns the string in all lowercase letters
indexOf(substring): returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring, or -1 if the substring is not found
lastIndexOf(substring): returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified substring, or -1 if the substring is not found
substring(start, end): returns a part of the string between the specified start and end indexes
split(separator): splits a string into an array of substrings based on the specified separator
replace(old, new): replaces all occurrences of a specified string with another string
concat(string2): concatenates two strings
These are some of the common string functions in javascript, however, there are many more string functions available.

The Below code demonstrates various string functions in JavaScript.

Slice: The slice() method returns a part of a string.
Split: The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator.
Replace: The replace() method is used to replace all occurrences of a specified string with another string.
Includes: The includes() method is used to check if an array includes a certain element.
Trim: The trim() method is used to remove whitespaces from both ends of a string.
PadStart and PadEnd: The padStart() method is used to pad the start of a string with a specified number of characters, and the padEnd() method is used to pad the end of a string with a specified number of characters.
Long literal strings: There are two ways to create a long literal string in javascript. First, by using the + operator to concatenate multiple strings, and second by using the \ to indicate a line continuation.
String.fromCharCode(): The String.fromCharCode() method is used to create a string from the specified sequence of Unicode values.

            An array is an object that can store multiple values at once.

The Array in JavaScript is a global object which contains a list of items. It is similar to any variable, in that you can use it to hold any type of data.

This is zero-based, which means that the index of the first element is 0. An element inside an array can be of any type, and different elements of the same array can be of different types : string, boolean, even objects or other arrays.

JavaScript provides a number of built-in functions, or methods, that can be used to manipulate arrays. These functions are part of the Array.prototype object and can be used on any array object in JavaScript. Some of the most commonly used array functions in JavaScript include:

length()	concat()	join()
constructor()	every()	forEach()
map()	includes()	pop()
push()	reduce()	shift()
slice()	splice()	sort()
indexOf()	fill()	delete
.push() - adds one or more elements to the end of an array
.pop() - removes the last element from an array
.shift() - removes the first element from an array
.unshift() - adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array
.slice() - returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array
.splice() - adds and/or removes elements from an array
.sort() - sorts the elements of an array in place
.reverse() - reverses the order of the elements in an array
.concat() - returns a new array that is a concatenation of the original array and one or more additional arrays or values
.join() - creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array with a specified separator.
These are just a few examples of the many array functions available in JavaScript, and there are many more to explore.

Example
let a=[10,20,30,40];
console.log(a);
console.table(a);
console.log(a[1]);

let b=new Array(10,20,30,40);
console.table(b);

let c=new Array("Joes",30,true,{m1:100,m2:75,m3:65});
console.table(c);

let result = products.includes("Pen");
console.log(result);
result = products.includes("Scale");
console.log(result);
result = products.includes("Pencil", 2);
console.log(result);

join()
The join() function in JavaScript is a method of the Array object, it is used to join all elements of an array into a single string. The elements of the array are separated by a specified delimiter or separator, which can be a string or a character.

The syntax for the join() function is as follows:

array.join(separator)
The join() function can also be used to join arrays of numbers, booleans, and other data types. The join() method does not modify the original array, it only returns a new string.

It's important to note that this method will not work if the array contains undefined or null elements. If it's possible that some elements in the array are undefined or null, it's a good practice to filter them before using the join function.

Source Code
//array.join(separator)
const products = ["Pen", "Pencil", "Eraser", "Box"];
console.log(products);

console.log(products.join()); //Deafult , as Separator
console.log(products.join('|')); // Pipe | as Separator

The above code to creates an array of strings called products which contains four elements: "Pen", "Pencil", "Eraser", and "Box".

The first console.log() statement simply outputs the array itself to the console. The second console.log() statement calls the join() method on the products array with no argument, which means it uses the default separator, which is a comma (,). This will output the elements of the array as a single string with commas separating each element: "Pen,Pencil,Eraser,Box"

The third console.log() statement calls the join() method on the products array and passes the separator | as an argument. This will output the elements of the array as a single string with pipe | characters separating each element: "Pen|Pencil|Eraser|Box"

It's important to note that the join() method does not modify the original array, it only returns a new string.

In this example, the join function is used to concatenate all the elements of the array into a single string, the first call to join will use the default separator (,) and the second call will use the separator |. The output of both calls will be different and it will be useful in different scenarios.

reverse()
The reverse() function in JavaScript is a method of the Array object, it is used to reverse the order of the elements in an array. It modifies the original array in place, meaning that it changes the order of the elements in the original array, and it doesn't return a new array.

The syntax for the reverse() function is as follows:

array.reverse()
You can also use the reverse function on an array of string, booleans, or any other data type. The reverse() method works by swapping the first element with the last one, the second element with the second to last one, and so on, until it reaches the middle of the array.

You can also use the reverse() method with an array of objects, but the order of the elements will be based on their memory addresses rather than their properties. If you need to sort an array of objects based on a specific property, you can use the sort() function with a comparator function, which compares the values of the specified property.

It's also important to note that, this method doesn't work on objects, it only works on Arrays.

For example, the below code demonstrates the use of the reverse() method in JavaScript.

The first part of the code creates an array called n which contains six elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The first console.log() statement outputs the original array to the console, labeled as "Before Reverse".

The second line of the code calls the reverse() method on the n array, which changes the order of the elements in the array. The elements are now in reverse order: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 The second console.log() statement outputs the reversed array to the console, labeled as "After Reverse".

The second part of the code creates an object called x which has properties 0, 1, 2, 3 and a length property 4. The first console.log() statement outputs the object to the console.

The next line of the code calls the reverse() method on the x object, but this will throw an error because the reverse method is only available for Arrays. To overcome this issue, the code uses the Array.prototype.reverse.call(x) method. This allows you to call the reverse() method on the x object, and it changes the order of the properties of the object. The second console.log() statement outputs the reversed object to the console.

It's important to note that, this way of reversing the properties of an object is not a standard way and it's not a recommended one because it's not a good practice to modify the Array's prototype, and it may cause unexpected behavior.

Source Code
const n = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log("Before Reverse : ", n);
n.reverse();
console.log("After Reverse : ", n);

//Array Element With Length Property
const x = { 0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30, 3: 40, length: 4 };
console.log(x);

Array.prototype.reverse.call(x);
console.log(x);

In summary, the reverse() method is useful to change the order of the elements in an array, reversing the order of the elements in the original array and it doesn't return a new array.

push()
The push() function in JavaScript is a method of the Array object, it is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array. It modifies the original array in place, meaning that it adds new elements to the end of the original array, and it doesn't return a new array.

The syntax for the push() function is as follows:

array.push(element1, element2, ..., elementX)
The push() method can also be used to add elements of any data type, including strings, booleans, and objects. It also increases the length of the array by the number of elements added.

It's important to note that, the push() method modifies the original array, it doesn't return a new array and you can use it to add elements to the end of an array regardless of its size.

The code demonstrates the use of the push() method in JavaScript.

The first part of the code creates an array called n which contains 5 elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The first console.log() statement outputs the original array to the console.

The next line calls the push() method on the n array, passing the value 60 as an argument. The element 60 is added to the end of the array, making the new array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 60] The second console.log() statement outputs the value returned by the push method, which is the new length of the array.

The next line calls the push() method on the n array again, passing multiple values 70, 85, 90, and 100 as arguments. These elements are added to the end of the array, making the new array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 60, 70, 85, 90, 100] The third console.log() statement outputs the array to the console.

The second part of the code creates an array called fruits which contains one element "Apple" The first console.log() statement outputs the original array to the console.

The next line calls the push() method on the fruits array, passing the value "Orange" as an argument. The element "Orange" is added to the end of the array, making the new array: ["Apple", "Orange"] The second console.log() statement outputs the array to the console.

The next line calls the push() method on the fruits array again, passing multiple values "Banana" and "Pineapple" as arguments. These elements are added to the end of the array, making the new array ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Pineapple"] The third console.log() statement outputs the array to the console.

The third part of the code creates two arrays called users1 and users2 which contains ["Ram", "Sam", "Ravi"] and ["Rajesh", "Kumar"] respectively. The next line uses the spread operator (...) and calls the push() method on the users1 array, passing the users2 array as an argument. This will merge the two arrays and add the elements

Source Code
let n = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(n);
console.log(n.push(60));
console.log(n);
console.log(n.push(70, 85, 90, 100));
console.log(n);

let fruits = ["Apple"]
console.log(fruits);
fruits.push("Orange");
console.log(fruits);
fruits.push("Banana", "Pineapple");
console.log(fruits);

//Merging Two Arrays
let users1 = ["Ram", "Sam", "Ravi"];
let users2 = ["Rajesh", "Kumar"];

users1.push(...users2);
console.log(users1);

In summary, the push() method is useful to add one or more elements to the end of an array, it increases the length of the array by the number of elements added, it modifies the original array and it doesn't return a new array.

pop()
The pop() function in JavaScript is a method of the Array object, it is used to remove the last element from an array and returns the removed element. It modifies the original array in place, meaning that it removes the last element of the original array, and it doesn't return a new array.

The syntax for the pop() function is as follows:

array.pop()
It's important to note that, the pop() method modifies the original array and it also decreases the length of the array by 1. If you call the pop method on an empty array, it returns undefined.

This Example demonstrates the use of the pop() method in JavaScript.

The code creates an array called users which contains four elements: 'Ram', 'Sam', 'Ravi' and 'Kumar'. The first console.log() statement outputs the original array to the console.

The next line calls the pop() method on the users array, which removes the last element from the array (in this case 'Kumar') and returns the removed element. The returned element is logged to the console. The second console.log() statement outputs the modified array to the console, which no longer contains the last element 'Kumar'.

The next line calls the pop() method on the users array again, which removes the last element from the array (in this case 'Ravi') and returns the removed element. The returned element is logged to the console. The third console.log() statement outputs the modified array to the console, which no longer contains the last element 'Ravi'.

It's important to note that, the pop() method modifies the original array and it also decreases the length of the array by 1. Each time the pop method is called, it removes the last element of the array and returns it. If the array is empty and the pop method is called, it returns undefined.

Source Code
//POP in JavaScript.
const users = ['Ram', 'Sam', 'Ravi', 'Kumar'];
console.log(users);
console.log(users.pop());
console.log(users);
console.log(users.pop());
console.log(users);

In summary, the code demonstrates the use of the pop() method to remove the last element of an array and return it. The method modifies the original array, decreases the length of the array by 1 and it doesn't return a new array.

shift()
The shift() function in JavaScript is a method of the Array object, is used to remove and return the first element of an array. It modifies the original array and changes its length. If the array is empty, undefined is returned.

The syntax for the shift() function is as follows:

array.shift()
Source Code
//Shift()
let students = ["Kumar", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley", "Rajesh"];

console.log("Before shift : " + students);
let element = students.shift();
console.log("After shift : " + students);
console.log("Removed Element : " + element);


console.log("Before shift : " + students);
element = students.shift();
console.log("After shift : " + students);
console.log("Removed Element : " + element);
To download raw file Click Here

This code demonstrates the usage of the shift() function in JavaScript.

The code defines an array named students which contains 6 elements: "Kumar", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley", and "Rajesh".

The first call to console.log() outputs the original array, "Before shift : Kumar,Aureen,Joes,Zara,Stanley,Rajesh".

Then, the shift() function is called on the students array, which removes the first element ("Kumar") from the array and assigns it to the variable element.

The second call to console.log() outputs the modified array, "After shift : Aureen,Joes,Zara,Stanley,Rajesh".

The third call to console.log() outputs the removed element, "Removed Element : Kumar"

Then, again the shift() function is called on the modified array, which removes the first element ("Aureen") from the array and assigns it to the variable element.

The fourth call to console.log() outputs the modified array after the second shift, "After shift : Joes,Zara,Stanley,Rajesh".

The fifth call to console.log() outputs the removed element, "Removed Element : Aureen"

The shift() function is used to remove the first element of an array and to return the removed element. Each time the shift() function is called on the array, it will remove the first element of the array and return that element, until all elements of the array are removed.

unshift()
In JavaScript, the unshift() function is used to add one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. It modifies the original array by adding new elements to the beginning of the array.

The syntax for the unshift() function is as follows:

array.unshift(element1,element2.....elementX)
Here's an example of how it can be used:

Source Code
//Unshift()
// Add First element at start
students = ["Kumar", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley", "Rajesh"];
console.log("Before unshift : " + students)

let len = students.unshift("Tiya");
console.log("Length : " + len)
console.log("After unshift : " + students)

//Mulitiple Values
len = students.unshift("Riya", "Diya");
console.log("Length : " + len);
console.log("After unshift : " + students);

This code demonstrates the usage of the unshift() function in JavaScript.

The code defines an array named students which contains 6 elements: "Kumar", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley", and "Rajesh".

The first call to console.log() outputs the original array, "Before unshift : Kumar,Aureen,Joes,Zara,Stanley,Rajesh".

Then, the unshift() function is called on the students array with the argument "Tiya" , which adds the "Tiya" element to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array which is assigned to variable len and then printed with the help of the second call to console.log().

The third call to console.log() outputs the modified array, "After unshift : Tiya,Kumar,Aureen,Joes,Zara,Stanley,Rajesh".

Then, again the unshift() function is called on the modified array with the arguments "Riya" and "Diya", which add the "Riya" and "Diya" elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array which is assigned to variable len and then printed with the help of the fourth call to console.log().

The fifth call to console.log() outputs the modified array, "After unshift : Riya,Diya,Tiya,Kumar,Aureen,Joes,Zara,Stanley,Rajesh".

The unshift() function is used to add one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. Each time the unshift() function is called on the array, it will add the new element(s) to the beginning of the array and return the new length of the array, until all desired elements are added.

indexOf()
In JavaScript, the indexOf() function JavaScript is used to search an array for a specific element and return the first index at which the element can be found. If the element is not present in the array, it will return -1.

The syntax for the indexOf() function is as follows:

array.indexOf(element)
Here's an example of how it can be used:

Source Code
students = ["Tiya", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley", "Rajesh"];

let i=students.indexOf("Tiya");
console.log("Index : "+i);

let user="Tutor Joes";
let index=user.indexOf("o");
console.log("Index : "+index);

index=user.indexOf("o",5);

The code defines an array named students which contains 6 elements: "Tiya", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley", and "Rajesh".

The first line of code calls the indexOf() function on the students array with the argument "Tiya", which searches the array for the first occurrence of "Tiya" and returns its index, which is then assigned to the variable i and printed with the help of the first call to console.log().

The second line of code defines a variable named user which is assigned the string value "Tutor Joes".

The third line of code calls the indexOf() function on the user string with the argument "o", which searches the string for the first occurrence of "o" and returns its index, which is then assigned to the variable index and printed with the help of the second call to console.log().

The fourth line of code calls the indexOf() function on the user string with the arguments "o" and 5 which specifies that it should start searching for the "o" from index 5, and returns its index, which is then assigned to the variable index and printed with the help of the third call to console.log().

In the last console.log() statement, the third call to console.log() outputs the index of the second o in the string which is 6.

It is important to note that the indexOf() method returns the first index at which the element can be found. If the element is not present in the array or string, it will return -1.

lastIndexOf()
In JavaScript, the lastIndexOf() function JavaScript is used to search an array or a string for a specific element and return the last index at which the element can be found. If the element is not present in the array or string, it will return -1. The lastIndexOf() function is similar to the indexOf() function, but instead of searching from the beginning of the array or string, it starts searching from the end.

It is important to note that the lastIndexOf() method checks for strict equality (===) between the elements

The syntax for the lastIndexOf() function is as follows:

array.lastIndexOf(element)
Here's an example of how it can be used:

Source Code
students = ["Tiya", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley","Tiya", "Rajesh"];

let i=students.indexOf("Tiya");
console.log(i);
i=students.lastIndexOf("Tiya");
console.log(i);

let address="Tutor Joes Cherry Road Salem Joes";
i=address.indexOf("Joes");
console.log(i);
i=address.lastIndexOf("Joes");
console.log(i);

This code demonstrates the usage of the indexOf() and lastIndexOf() functions in JavaScript.

The code defines an array named students which contains 7 elements: "Tiya", "Aureen", "Joes", "Zara", "Stanley", "Tiya", and "Rajesh".

The first line of code calls the indexOf() function on the students array with the argument "Tiya", which searches the array for the first occurrence of "Tiya" and returns its index, which is then assigned to the variable i and printed with the help of the first call to console.log().

The second line of code calls the lastIndexOf() function on the students array with the argument "Tiya", which searches the array for the last occurrence of "Tiya" and returns its index, which is then assigned to the variable i and printed with the help of the second call to console.log().

The third line of code defines a variable named address which is assigned the string value "Tutor Joes Cherry Road Salem Joes".

The fourth line of code calls the indexOf() function on the address string with the argument "Joes", which searches the string for the first occurrence

every() & some()
In JavaScript, the every() and some() functions are used to perform a test on all elements of an array and return a Boolean value indicating whether all or some of the elements pass the test, respectively.

The every() function takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array. The callback function is passed three arguments: the current element, the index of the current element, and the array itself. If the callback function returns true for every element in the array, the every() function returns true. If the callback function returns false for any element in the array, the every() function returns false.

The some() function also takes a callback function as an argument, and it also calls it for each element in the array. If the callback function returns true for any element in the array, the some() function returns true. If the callback function returns false

Here's an example of how it can be used:

Source Code
n = [12, 18, 10, 8];

let result=n.every((value)=>{
  return value%2==0;
});

console.log("All Elements are Even :" ,result);

result=n.some((value)=>{
  return value%2==0;
});

console.log("All Elements are Even :" ,result);


function checkEven(value) {
  return value % 2 == 0;
}

result=n.every(checkEven);

console.log("checkEven All Elements are Even :" ,result);


const users = [
  { name: "Ram", age: 25},
  { name: "Tiya", age: 45},
  { name: "Raja", age: 18},
  { name: "Sara", age: 12}
];

function isEligible(element) {
  return element.age>=18;
}

result = users.every(isEligible);
console.log("Every Eligible :" , result);

result = users.some(isEligible);
console.log("Some Eligible :" , result);

This code demonstrates the usage of the every() and some() functions in JavaScript.

The code defines an array named n which contains 4 elements: 12, 18, 10, 8.

The first line of code calls the every() function on the n array and passed a callback function that checks if each element is even by using the modulus operator. Since all elements of the array are even, the every() function returns true.

The second line of code calls the some() function on the n array with the same callback function, which checks if any element of the array is even. Since all elements of the array are even, the some() function also returns true.

The third line of code defines a function named checkEven which takes a value and checks if it is even. The every() function is called on the n array with checkEven function passed as an argument. As the result it returns true.

The code then defines an array of objects named users which contains 4 objects, each representing a user with properties name and age.

The isEligible function is defined which takes an element and checks if its age is greater than or equal to 18.

The every() function is called on the users array with the isEligible function passed as an argument. As it only Raja object is not eligible, it returns false

The some() function is called on the users array with the isEligible function passed as an argument. As Ram and Tiya objects are eligible, it returns true

        <summary>The difference between Primitive and Reference Data Types</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, there are two types of data types: primitive and reference.

String: used to represent text, enclosed in single or double quotes.
Number: used to represent numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
Boolean: used to represent true or false values.
Undefined: used to represent a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Symbol: a new type in ECMAScript 6, used for creating unique identifiers.
Primitive data types are stored in the stack memory, and when a variable is assigned a primitive value, it is assigned a copy of that value. This means that when you change the value of a primitive variable, it does not affect any other variables that have the same value.

Reference data types, on the other hand, are objects and arrays. They are stored in the heap memory, and when a variable is assigned a reference value, it is assigned a reference to the object or array in the heap. This means that when you change the value of a reference variable, it will affect any other variables that reference the same object or array.

In summary, Primitive data types are basic data types in JavaScript which are stored in the stack memory, and when you change the value of a primitive variable, it does not affect any other variables that have the same value. While Reference data types are objects and arrays which are stored in the heap memory and when you change the value of a reference variable, it will affect any other variables that reference the same object or array.

Primitive data types in JS
Here are some examples of primitive and reference data types in JavaScript

Primitive data types
Example
let name = "Tutor Joes";  // String
let age = 30;           // Number
let isStudent = false;  // Boolean
let x;                  // Undefined
let id = Symbol();      // Symbol
Reference data types
Reference data types in JS
Example
let user = {name: "Tutor Joes", age: 30};  // Object
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];             // Array
let today = new Date();                    // Object
Here's an example of how primitive and reference data types behave differently when assigned to multiple variables:

let x = 10;
let y = x;
x = 20;
console.log(x); // 20
console.log(y); // 10

let user = {name: "John Doe", age: 30};
let user2 = user;
user.age = 25;
console.log(user.age); // 25
console.log(user2.age); // 25
In the first example, the value of x is changed to 20, but the value of y remains 10, because x and y are primitive data types and they have different memory location.

In the second example, the value of user.age is changed to 25, and the value of user2.age also changes to 25, because user and user2 are reference data types, and they reference the same object in memory, so changing one of them will change the other.

Another Array example for reference data types

let arr1=[10,20,30];
let arr2=arr1;
console.log("Array 1 :",arr1);
console.log("Array 2 :",arr2);
arr1.push(40);
console.log("After Pushing element to arr1 : ");
console.log("Array 1 :",arr1);
console.log("Array 2 :",arr2);
In this code, the variable arr1 is assigned the value of an array, which is a reference data type. The variable arr2 is then assigned the value of arr1. This means that arr2 is a reference to the same array in memory as arr1.

When an element is pushed to arr1 using the push method, because both arr1 and arr2 are pointing to the same memory location, the change made to arr1 (i.e adding an element) is also reflected in arr2.

This behavior is different from primitive data types, where if you change the value of one variable, it does not affect the value of another variable that has the same value.

Object Clone use Spread and Object.assign() in JavaScript

The Object.assign() method is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object. Here is an example:

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };
const obj3 = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
console.log(obj3); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
The spread operator (...) can also be used to create a shallow copy of an object. Here is an example:

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };
const obj3 = {...obj1, ...obj2};
console.log(obj3); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
It should be noted that both Object.assign() and the spread operator create a shallow copy, meaning that if the object being copied contains references to other objects, those references will still be present in the copy and any changes made to the original object will be reflected in the copy. If you want to create a deep copy, you can use a library such as lodash.

In conclusion, the above code demonstrates the difference between primitive data types and reference data types in JavaScript. Primitive data types are stored in memory as a single value, while reference data types are stored as a reference or pointer to the location in memory where the value is stored. This means that if two variables are assigned a reference data type, they will both point to the same location in memory and any changes made to one variable will also be reflected in the other variable. Understanding this concept is important for proper memory management and avoiding unexpected behavior in JavaScript.

        <summary>Multiple ways to clone an array in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
            There are multiple ways to create a clone of an array in JavaScript. Some of the most common ways are:

Method-1
Using theSpread operator: The spread operator allows you to spread the elements of an array into a new array. It creates a shallow copy of the array.

Example
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let clonedArray = [...originalArray];
console.log(clonedArray);  // [1, 2, 3]
Method-2
Using theslice() method: The slice() method creates a shallow copy of the array. It takes no arguments, it will create a copy of the entire array.

Example
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let clonedArray = originalArray.slice();
console.log(clonedArray);  // [1, 2, 3]
Method-3
Using theconcat() method: The concat() method creates a new array with the elements of the original array and any additional elements that you pass to it.

Example
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let clonedArray = [].concat(originalArray);
console.log(clonedArray);  // [1, 2, 3]
Method-4
Using theArray.from() method: The Array.from() method creates a new array with the elements of the original array.

Example
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let clonedArray = Array.from(originalArray);
console.log(clonedArray);  // [1, 2, 3]
Method-5
Using theJSON.parse() and JSON.stringify(): JSON.stringify() method convert the javascript object into json format and JSON.parse() method converts json string into javascript object.

Example
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let clonedArray = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalArray));
console.log(clonedArray);  // [1, 2, 3]
It's important to note that all the above methods create a shallow copy of the array, which means it will copy the elements of the original array but not the objects inside the array.

        <summary>Understanding the Use of const for Creating Arrays in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript offers several ways to declare variables, including var, let, and const. Each keyword has its own unique behavior and use cases. In this blog post, we will focus on the use of const for creating arrays in JavaScript.

When creating an array in JavaScript, you can use the const keyword to declare a constant variable that refers to an array. For example:

const users=["Ram","Sam","Ravi"];
users.push("Tiya");
console.log(users);
The const keyword ensures that the variable users cannot be reassigned to a new value. For example, you cannot do users = ["John", "Doe"]; which would throw an error.

However, the const keyword does not prevent modifications to the array elements themselves. The array is an object in JavaScript, and the elements inside the array are properties of that object. Therefore, you can still perform operations on the array elements, such as pushing new elements to the array, changing the value of an element, or using the splice method to remove elements.

In the code you've provided, the users.push("Tiya") method is used to add a new element "Tiya" to the end of the array. This is a valid operation and the element is added to the array. The console.log(users) statement then logs the updated array to the console, which now has 4 elements ["Ram","Sam","Ravi","Tiya"].

Using the const keyword to declare an array in JavaScript has the following benefits:

It prevents the variable from being reassigned to a new value. This can be useful for maintaining the integrity of your data and ensuring that unexpected reassignments do not occur in your code.
It makes it clear to other developers that the array is meant to be constant and should not be reassigned.
It allows the elements inside the array to be modified. For example, you can still push elements to an array, change the value of an element, or use the splice method to remove elements even if the array is declared using const.
It's worth noting that, while the const keyword is generally recommended for arrays that should not be reassigned, let keyword can also be used in situations where you want to allow the array to be reassigned but still want to prevent modification to the elements inside the array.

In summary, using const keyword to create an array is a good practice to ensure that the array is not reassigned and it makes clear to other developers that this array is meant to be a constant.

        <summary>Efficient Variable Assignment with Array and Object Destructuring in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
            Array destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way to extract values from arrays and assign them to variables. The basic syntax for array destructuring is as follows:

let [variable1, variable2, ..., variableN] = array;
For example, if you have an array of numbers and you want to assign the first, second and third elements to separate variables, you can use array destructuring like this:

let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
let [a, b, c] = numbers;
console.log(a); //10
console.log(b); //20
console.log(c); //30
In the above example, the first element of the numbers array is assigned to the variable "a", the second element is assigned to the variable "b", and the third element is assigned to the variable "c".

You can also use destructuring to extract elements from nested arrays. For example, you can de-structure an array of arrays like this:

let nestedArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
let [[a, b], [c, d], [e, f]] = nestedArray;
console.log(a); //1
console.log(b); //2
console.log(c); //3
console.log(d); //4
console.log(e); //5
console.log(f); //6
You can also use destructuring to extract elements from the end of an array like this:

let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
let [a, b, ...c] = numbers;
console.log(a); //10
console.log(b); //20
console.log(c); // [30,40,50]
In the above example ...c is called rest pattern, it will gather all the remaining element into an array

In summary, array destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way to extract values from arrays and assign them to variables. It allows you to easily extract elements from arrays and assign them to variables in a concise and readable way.

Array destructuring in JavaScript on Objects
In JavaScript, you can also use de-structuring to extract values from objects and assign them to variables. The basic syntax for object de-structuring is as follows:

let {property1: variable1, property2: variable2, ..., propertyN: variableN} = object;
For example, if you have an object with properties "name", "age" and "gender" and you want to assign the values of those properties to separate variables, you can use object destructuring like this:

let person = {name: "Tiya", age: 5, gender: "female"};
let {name, age, gender} = person;
console.log(name); // "Tiya"
console.log(age); // 5
console.log(gender); // "female"
You can also use destructuring to extract values from nested objects. For example, you can de-structure an object with nested objects like this:

let address = {street: "Cherry Road", city: "Salem", state: "Tamil Nadu", zip: "636007"};
let employee = {name: "Tiya", age: 12, gender: "female", address};
let {name, age, gender, address: {city, state, zip}} = employee;
console.log(name); // "Tiya"
console.log(age); // 30
console.log(gender); // "female"
console.log(city); // "Salem"
console.log(state); // "Tamil Nadu"
console.log(zip); // "636007"
You can also use destructuring to set default values for properties that might be missing from the object. For example, you can destructure an object and set default values for properties like this:

let {name = "guest", age = 25, gender = "unknown"} = person;
console.log(name); // "John"
console.log(age); // 30
console.log(gender); // "male"
In the above example, if the person object does not contain the name,age and gender properties, the destructuring will assign the default values to the variables.

In summary, object destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way to extract values from objects and assign them to variables. It allows you to easily extract properties from objects and assign them to variables in a concise and readable way, also it allows you to set default values for properties that might be missing from the object.

        <summary>Comparing Arrays and Objects in JavaScript: Advantages and Disadvantages
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, arrays and objects are both used to store collections of data, but they are used in different ways.

Array
An array is a collection of items stored in a single variable.

The items in an array are ordered, and each item is accessed by its position in the array (also known as its index).

Arrays are commonly used to store lists of items, such as a list of numbers, a list of names, or a list of objects.

Arrays are defined using square brackets, with items separated by commas.

Example
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numbers[0]); // output: 1
Advantages
Arrays are used to store lists of items, which can be easily accessed, manipulated, and iterated through using various array methods such as map, filter, and forEach. Arrays are also efficient for searching and sorting large amounts of data. The position of an item in an array (index) can be easily accessed which makes it easy to retrieve any data.

Disadvantages
Arrays are less efficient for storing large amounts of data when the keys are not numbers. Retrieving a specific value in an array can be slower for large arrays since you need to iterate through the array to find the value.

Objects
An object is a collection of key-value pairs stored in a single variable.

The keys in an object are used to access the values, and the keys and values can be of any data type.

Objects are commonly used to store related data, such as a collection of properties for a single item, or a collection of methods for an object.

Objects are defined using curly braces, with keys and values separated by colons.

Example
let person = {name: "Tiya", age: 12, job: "Developer"};
console.log(person.name); // output: "Tiya"
Advantages
Objects are used to store key-value pairs of related data, which can be easily accessed, manipulated, and iterated through using various object methods such as for...in and Object.keys()

Objects are better suited for storing large amounts of data when the keys are strings, because it is faster to retrieve values using keys than to iterate through an array.

Disadvantages
Objects are less efficient for searching and sorting large amounts of data because it does not have any built-in methods to perform these operations.

The order of the keys in an object is not guaranteed, which can make it harder to work with if the order is important.

In summary, arrays are used to store lists of items, while objects are used to store key-value pairs of related data.

In conclusion, arrays and objects are both useful data structures in JavaScript, but they have their own advantages and disadvantages. Arrays are great for storing lists of items and are efficient for searching and sorting large amounts of data. On the other hand, objects are better suited for storing key-value pairs of related data and are more efficient for retrieving data using keys. Ultimately, the choice between using an array or an object will depend on the specific needs of your project and the type of data you are working with.

        <summary>Creating Objects in JavaScript: A Detailed Guide
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, objects are used to store collections of data and methods. There are multiple ways to create objects in JavaScript, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the scenario.

1.Using object literals:
This is the most common and simplest way to create an object. Object literals are enclosed in curly braces {} and consist of a set of key-value pairs. Here is an example:

const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    job: "Developer"
};
console.log(person);
2.Using the object constructor:
The object constructor is a built-in function in JavaScript, which is used to create an object prototype. Here is an example:

const person = new Object();
person.name = "John";
person.age = 30;
person.job = "Developer";
console.log(person);
3. Using the Object.create() method:
The Object.create() method is used to create an object with a specific prototype. example:

const personProto = {
sayHello: function() {
console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
};
const person = Object.create(personProto);
person.name = "John";
person.age = 30;
person.job = "Developer";
console.log(person);
In the above code snippet, we are creating an object called "personProto" that contains a single method "sayHello()". This method takes advantage of the "this" keyword to reference the "name" property of the object it is called on.

Next, we use the Object.create() method to create a new object called "person" that is based on the "personProto" object. This is known as object prototypal inheritance.

We then add properties to the "person" object, such as "name", "age", and "job". These properties are specific to this object and are not present on the "personProto" object.

Finally, we log the "person" object to the console, which will show all of its properties and methods.

One of the advantages of using the Object.create() method is that it allows for efficient object inheritance and property addition without the need for a constructor function and the "new" keyword. Additionally, it allows for easy separation of methods and properties shared among objects and those that are specific to an individual object.

However, one of the disadvantages of using Object.create() is that it is not supported in all older browsers. So, If you are planning to create a web application, you need to ensure that your application works on all browsers and platforms.

In conclusion, the Object.create() method is a powerful tool for creating objects in JavaScript and allows for efficient object inheritance and property addition. However, it is important to be aware of its browser support limitations when building web applications.

4.Using class:
The class is the latest addition to creating objects in JavaScript. example:

class Person {
constructor(name, age, job) {
        this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.job = job;
    }
}
const person = new Person("Tiya", 30, "Developer");
console.log(person);
This code creates a class called "Person" using the class keyword. The class has a constructor method which is called when a new object of the class is created using the "new" keyword. The constructor takes 3 parameters: name, age, and job. Inside the constructor method, the "this" keyword is used to create properties on the object being created, and set their values to the values of the arguments passed to the constructor method.

In this example, a new object of the class "Person" is created and assigned to the variable "person". The values "Tiya", 30, and "Developer" are passed as arguments to the constructor method. This causes the properties "name", "age" and "job" to be created on the "person" object, and their values set to "Tiya", 30, and "Developer" respectively.

At the end of the code, the "console.log(person)" is used to log the object to the console. This will display the object with its properties and values.

Once an object is created, you can add properties and methods to it, and access them using dot notation (person.name) or bracket notation (person["name"]).

Additionally, you can use destructuring to extract data from an object. Here is an example:

const {name,age,job} = person;
console.log(name);
In conclusion, the choice of creating an object will depend on the specific requirements of your application. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages and it's important to understand them to make the best use of them.

        <summary>Exploring the Differences between Dot Notation and Bracket Notation in JavaScript Objects: A Guide
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, objects can be accessed using either dot notation or bracket notation.

Dot notation is used to access object properties using a dot followed by the property name. For example, if an object has a property called "name", it can be accessed using the following syntax:

object.name
Bracket notation is used to access object properties using the object name inside a set of square brackets [] followed by the property name. For example, if an object has a property called "name", it can also be accessed using the following syntax:

object["name"]
One key difference between the two is that dot notation can only be used to access properties that have valid identifier names, while bracket notation can be used to access properties using any string, including variables and expressions. Additionally, bracket notation is useful when the property name is not known until runtime.

In general, dot notation is more readable and easier to understand, but bracket notation can be more flexible.

Here is an example of using dot notation and bracket notation in JavaScript objects:

const user = {
    name: "Tutor Joes",
    age: 30,
    job: "Developer"
};

// Dot notation
console.log(user.name); // Output: "Tutor Joes"
user.name = "Joes";
console.log(user.name); // Output: "Joes"

// Bracket notation
console.log(user["age"]); // Output: 30
user["age"] = 25;
console.log(user["age"]); // Output: 25
In the above example, we first create an object called "user" with properties "name", "age", and "job". We then use dot notation to access the "name" property and change its value to "Joes". We also use bracket notation to access the "age" property and change its value to 25.

The main difference between dot notation and bracket notation in JavaScript object is the way you access and modify the properties of the object.

Dot notation is used to access and modify the properties of an object using the "." operator. For example, in the example above, we use user.name to access the "name" property of the object and user.name = "Joes" to change the value of the "name" property.

Bracket notation is used to access and modify the properties of an object using the "[]" operator. For example, in the example above, we use user["age"] to access the "age" property of the object and user["age"] = 25 to change the value of the "age" property.

One of the main advantages of using bracket notation is that it allows you to access properties using variables. For example, you can use a variable to store the property name and then use that variable in the bracket notation to access the property.

const prop = "name";
console.log(user[prop]); // Output: "Joes"
Another advantage of using bracket notation is that it allows you to use property names that are not valid JavaScript identifiers.

In contrast, dot notation can only be used with property names that are valid JavaScript identifiers.

Both dot notation and bracket notation have their own advantages and disadvantages. It's depended on your requirement and use case which one you want to use.

Keys with Space
In JavaScript, keys in object cannot have spaces when using either dot notation or bracket notation to access them. If a key has a space in it, you will need to use bracket notation and put the key in quotes to access it. For example, if you have an object like this:

let user = {
"first name": "Tutor",
"last name": "Joes"
};
You would use bracket notation to access the values like this:

console.log(user["first name"]); // "Tutor"
console.log(user["last name"]); // "Joes"
If you try to use dot notation, it will not work and throw a syntax error, as the key contains spaces.

console.log(user.first name); // This will throw a SyntaxError
You can use a variable to store the key and use it in bracket notation, like this:

let key = 'first name';
console.log(user[key]); // "Tutor"
In general, it's better to avoid keys with spaces in them, it's more readable and less error-prone.

In conclusion, both dot notation and bracket notation are used to access properties of JavaScript objects. However, they have some key differences. Dot notation is simpler and easier to read, but it can only be used with valid identifiers, whereas bracket notation allows the use of any string as a property name. Additionally, bracket notation can be used to access properties using variables, whereas dot notation cannot. Therefore, depending on your use case, one notation may be more suitable than the other.

        <summary>Iterating Through JavaScript Objects: A Guide with Examples
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, objects can be iterated through using several methods, including the for-in loop, Object.keys(), Object.values(),and Object.entries().

Example 1: Using the for-in loop
const user = {
    name: "Tiya",
    age: 30,
    job: "Programmer"
};

for (let key in user) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${user[key]}`);
}
Output
name: Tiya
age: 30
job: Programmer
Example 2: Using Object.keys()
const user = {
    name: "Tiya",
    age: 30,
    job: "Programmer"
};

const keys = Object.keys(user);
keys.forEach(key => {
    console.log(`${key}: ${user[key]}`);
});

Output
name: Tiya
age: 30
job: Programmer
Example 3: Using Object.values()
const user = {
    name: "Tiya",
    age: 30,
    job: "Programmer"
};

const values = Object.values(user);
values.forEach(value => {
    console.log(value);
});
Output
Tiya
30
Programmer
Example 4: Using Object.entries()
const user = {
    name: "Tiya",
    age: 30,
    job: "Programmer"
};

const entries = Object.entries(user);
entries.forEach(entry => {
    console.log(`${entry[0]}: ${entry[1]}`);
});
Output
name: Tiya
age: 30
job: Programmer
we can use many different ways to iterate through JavaScript objects using a for loop.iterate through an object is using the Object.keys() method. This method returns an array of the object's own property names. Here is an example:

const person = {
    name: "Tiya",
    age: 30,
    job: "Programmer"
};

const keys = Object.keys(person);
<!-- for (let i = 0; i<keys.length; i++) { -->
    console.log(keys[i] + ": " + person[keys[i]]);
}
In this example, we are using the Object.keys() method to get an array of the object's own property names. We can then use a traditional for loop to iterate through the array.

Output
name: Tiya
age: 30
job: Programmer

Lastly, we can use the Object.entries() method to iterate through an object. This method returns an array of arrays, where each inner array is a key-value pair of the object's properties. Here is an example:

const person = {
    name: "Tiya",
    age: 30,
    job: "Programmer"
};

const entries = Object.entries(person);
<!-- for (let i = 0; i<entries.length; i++) { -->
    console.log(entries[i][0] + ": " + entries[i][1]);
} 
In this example, we are using the Object.entries() method to get an array of arrays, where each inner array is a key-value pair of the object's properties. We can then use a traditional for loop to iterate through the array.

Output
name: Tiya
age: 30
job: Programmer

In conclusion, there are several ways to iterate through JavaScript objects and each method has its own use case. The for-in loop is useful when you need to access both the keys and values of an object, Object.keys() and Object.values() are useful when you only need to access the keys or values respectively, and Object.entries() is useful when you need to access both the keys and values in an iterable format.

        <summary>Computed Property Names in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide
        </summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript objects are a powerful data structure that allows developers to store and manipulate data in a flexible and organized manner. One of the most powerful features of JavaScript objects is the ability to create properties with computed property names.

Computed property names allow developers to define the name of an object property at runtime, rather than at the time of object creation. This means that the property name can be determined based on the value of a variable or the result of an expression.

For example, consider the following code:

const key1="name";
const key2="age";
const value1="Joes";
const value2=35;
const user={
    [key1]:value1,
    [key2]:value2,
}
console.log(user);
In this example, we are using computed property names to create two properties in the user object. The property names, "name" and "age", are determined by the values of the variables key1 and key2, respectively. The values of these properties, "Joes" and 35, are determined by the values of the variables value1 and value2, respectively.

When we run the code and log the user object to the console, we get the following output:

{name: "Joes", age: 35}
As we can see, the properties of the user object have been created with the computed property names, "name" and "age", and the values, "Joes" and 35, respectively.

Computed property names can also be used in conjunction with destructuring assignment to extract values from an object. For example, the following code uses computed property names to extract the value of the "name" property from the user object:

const { [key1]: name } = user;
console.log(name); // "Joes"
Computed property names are a powerful feature of JavaScript objects that allow for more dynamic and flexible code. They can be used to create properties with dynamic names, extract values from objects, and improve code readability.

In conclusion, computed property names in JavaScript is a powerful feature that allows developers to create properties with dynamic names and extract values from objects. It makes the code more flexible and readable.

        <summary>Unleashing the power of Spread operator in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            The spread operator (...) in JavaScript is used to spread the elements of an iterable (such as an array or object) into a new array or object. It allows you to copy all of the elements of an array or object into a new one without changing the original.

For example, you can use the spread operator to create a new array with all of the elements of an existing array:

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = [...originalArray];
console.log(newArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
You can also use the spread operator to merge two arrays into a single array:

const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(mergedArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Similarly, you can use the spread operator to create a new object with all of the properties of an existing object:

const originalObject = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
const newObject = {...originalObject};
console.log(newObject); // {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
You can also use the spread operator to merge two objects into a single object

const obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};
const obj2 = {c: 3, d: 4};
const mergedObject = {...obj1, ...obj2};
console.log(mergedObject); // {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}
The spread operator can be used in many other ways to manipulate arrays and objects in JavaScript.

In conclusion, the spread operator in JavaScript is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily manipulate arrays and objects. It can be used for tasks such as merging arrays, cloning objects, and transforming objects into arrays. The spread operator can also be used in combination with other array and object methods to create more complex and dynamic code.

As a developer, it's important to understand and utilize this feature to make your code more efficient and readable.

        <summary>Organizing Data with Objects inside Arrays in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
            Objects inside arrays are a common pattern in JavaScript, as arrays are often used to store collections of similar data. For example, an array of user objects might look like this:

const users = [
        { name: 'joes', age: 25, email: 'joes@gmail.com' },
        { name: 'ram', age: 32, email: 'ram@gmail.com' },
        { name: 'sam', age: 45, email: 'sam@gmail.com' }
    ];
This array contains three objects, each representing a user with properties such as name, age, and email. This kind of data structure is commonly used in web development to store and manipulate information about users, products, or other entities.

One common use case for objects inside arrays is to loop through the array and perform some action on each object. For example, we might want to display the names of all users on a website:

for (const user of users) {
        console.log(user.name);
}
Output
joes
ram
sam
Another use case is to filter the array based on certain properties of the objects. For example, we might want to find all users who are older than 30:

const olderUsers = users.filter(user =>user.age> 30);
console.log(olderUsers);
Output
[
    { name: 'ram', age: 32, email: 'ram@gmail.com' },
    { name: 'sam', age: 45, email: 'sam@gmail.com' }
]

Objects inside arrays in JavaScript can be used to store and organize related data in a structured way. They can be used to store information about multiple items, such as a list of products, users, or events.

Advantages of using objects inside arrays in JavaScript include:

Organization: Storing related data in a structured way makes it easy to access, update and manage the data.
Reusability: You can easily reuse the same object structure for different data sets, making the code more efficient.
Flexibility: Using objects inside arrays allows you to store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and even other objects.
Iteration: It allows for easy iteration using for loops or array methods such as map, filter, and reduce.
Examples of usage include:
Storing a list of products in an e-commerce application
Storing a list of users in a social media application
Storing a list of events in a calendar application
You can use the array methods to iterate through the array and access each object and its properties, or use destructuring and spread operator to manipulate the data efficiently. Overall, using objects inside arrays in JavaScript can greatly enhance the functionality and organization of your code. In Conclusion, Objects inside arrays are a powerful pattern in JavaScript, enabling developers to store, manipulate and organize data in a more efficient way.

        <summary>Mastering JavaScript Functions: Understanding the Different Types</summary>
        <pre>
            What is Function?
In JavaScript, a function is a block of code that can be executed by calling it by its name, and can optionally take in parameters and return a value. Functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript and are used to perform specific tasks or compute values. They are often used to organize and structure code, making it more modular and reusable. Functions can be declared in several ways in JavaScript, including function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions.

Function Declaration
A function declaration in JavaScript is a way to define a function and make it available for use in your code. It follows a specific syntax, where the keyword "function" is followed by the function name, a set of parentheses that may include parameters, and a block of code enclosed in curly braces that defines the function's behavior.

For example

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
In this example, the function is named "add" and it takes in two parameters, "a" and "b". The function's behavior is defined within the curly braces, where it simply returns the sum of "a" and "b". This function can now be called by referencing its name, followed by the arguments in parentheses, like so:

let result = add(3, 5);  // result = 8
Function declarations are hoisted, which means that they are available for use throughout the entire scope in which they are defined, even before they are executed. This allows you to call a function before it is defined in your code.

Function with a return statement
A function with a return statement is a function that, when called, evaluates one or more expressions and returns a value to the calling code. The return statement is used to specify the value that the function should return.

For example

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(1, 2)); // Output: 3
In this example, the function add takes two parameters a and b, and returns their sum using the return statement. When the function is called with the arguments 1 and 2, it returns the value 3 which is then logged to the console. Function with return statement can be used to perform calculation, make decision and return the output as per the requirement.

Function with Arbitrary arguments
In JavaScript, a function can accept an arbitrary number of arguments using the "arguments" keyword. This keyword refers to an object that contains all of the arguments passed to the function. The arguments can be accessed like an array, using square brackets []. For example:

function sum() {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i arguments.length; i++) {
        total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // 15
Additionally, the spread operator (...) can also be used to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. The spread operator allows the elements of an array to be spread out into individual arguments. For example:

function sum(...args) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i args.length; i++) {
        total += args[i];
    }
    return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // 15
Both the examples will give the same output.

Function as Expression
In JavaScript, a function can also be defined as an expression. This means that a function can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function.

For example, the following code defines a function and assigns it to a variable named "add":

const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};
console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3
Arrow Function
An arrow function, also known as a "fat arrow" function, is a shorthand syntax for defining a function in JavaScript. It was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and is now a widely used feature in JavaScript development.

The basic syntax for an arrow function is as follows:

const functionName = (parameters) =>{ function body };
For example

const add = (a, b) =>{ return a + b };
console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3
If the function body contains a single expression, you can also use the shorthand syntax, omitting the curly braces and the "return" keyword:

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3
Arrow functions have some important differences when compared to traditional function expressions:

The "this" keyword inside an arrow function refers to the same "this" as the surrounding scope, and it is not redefined when the function is invoked.
Arrow functions do not have a "arguments" object, and you should use the rest parameter syntax instead.
Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
Arrow functions are useful for creating concise, readable code and for passing anonymous functions as arguments to other functions.
Here is the some more examples of using arrow functions in JavaScript with detailed explanations:

1. Using arrow functions with map():
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
In this example, the map() method is used to iterate over an array of numbers and double each one. The arrow function number => number * 2 is passed as an argument to the map() method and is invoked for each element in the array. The result is a new array with the doubled numbers.

2. Using arrow functions with filter():
let words = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape'];
let filteredWords = words.filter(word =>word.length> 5);
console.log(filteredWords); // ['banana', 'orange']
In this example, the filter() method is used to filter out elements in an array of words that are shorter than 5 characters. The arrow function word =>word.length> 5 is passed as an argument to the filter() method and is invoked for each element in the array. The result is a new array containing only the words that are longer than 5 characters.

3. Using arrow functions with reduce():
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let total = numbers.reduce((sum, number) => sum + number, 0);
console.log(total); // 15
In this example, the reduce() method is used to iterate over an array of numbers and add them together. The arrow function (sum, number) => sum + number is passed as the first argument to the reduce() method and is invoked for each element in the array. The second argument, 0, is the initial value of the accumulator (sum). The result is the total sum of all the numbers in the array.

4. Using arrow functions to create a closure:
let createCounter = () => {
  let count = 0;
  return () => {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
};
let counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
In this example, the reduce() method is used to iterate over an array of numbers and add them together. The arrow function (sum, number) => sum + number is passed as the first argument to the reduce() method and is invoked for each element in the array. The second argument, 0, is the initial value of the accumulator (sum). The result is the total sum of all the numbers in the array.

In this example, an arrow function is used to create a closure. The outer function createCounter returns an inner function that increments and returns a variable count. Because the inner function is defined inside the outer function, it has access to the variable count and maintains its state even after the outer function has returned.

These examples demonstrate how arrow functions can be used to write more concise and readable code, particularly when working with arrays, functions, and closures.

Default Parameter Function
A default parameter function is a function in which one or more parameters have a default value specified. In the event that the caller of the function does not provide a value for that parameter, the default value will be used instead.

function addition(a,b=5)
{
    return a+b;
}
console.log(addition(25,30));
console.log(addition(25));
In the above code, the function "addition" has two parameters: "a" and "b". The parameter "b" has a default value of 5, meaning that if the caller of the function does not provide a value for "b", the value 5 will be used.

The first call to the function, "console.log(addition(25,30))", passes in two arguments: 25 for "a" and 30 for "b". The function returns the sum of these values (25 + 30 = 55), which is then logged to the console.

The second call to the function, "console.log(addition(25))", only passes in one argument: 25 for "a". Since no value is provided for "b", the default value of 5 is used. The function returns the sum of these values (25 + 5 = 30), which is then logged to the console.

Function hoisting
Function hoisting is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to call a function before it is defined in the code. This occurs because when JavaScript is interpreted, all function declarations are moved to the top of their scope, which is known as hoisting.

Here's an example of function hoisting:

hoistedFunction(); // Output: "I'm a hoisted function"

function hoistedFunction() {
   console.log("I'm a hoisted function");
}

In this example, the function hoistedFunction is called before it is defined in the code. However, it still executes successfully because the function declaration is hoisted to the top of the scope, making it available to call throughout the entire scope.

It's important to note that function hoisting applies only to function declarations and not function expressions.

notHoistedFunction(); // ReferenceError
let notHoistedFunction = function(){
    console.log("I'm a function expression");
}
In this example, calling notHoistedFunction before the function expression is defined will result in a ReferenceError

Function hoisting can be useful in certain situations but it can also lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly. It's good practice to always define functions before calling them in your code to avoid confusion and bugs.

Nested Function
In JavaScript, it is possible to define a function inside another function, also known as a nested function. A nested function has access to the variables and functions in the parent function's scope, also known as the enclosing scope.

Here's an example of a nested function:

function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = 'I am a variable in the outer function';

  function innerFunction() {
    let innerVariable = 'I am a variable in the inner function';
    console.log(outerVariable); // Output: "I am a variable in the outer function"
    console.log(innerVariable); // Output: "I am a variable in the inner function"
  }

innerFunction();
}
outerFunction();
In this example, the outerFunction defines a variable called outerVariable and a nested function called innerFunction. The innerFunction has access to the outerVariable and can access and use it.

Nested functions can be useful for creating more modular and organized code. They can also be used to create closures, which are functions that maintain their state even after they have returned.

It's important to note that inner functions have access to the variables and functions in the parent function, but the parent function doesn't have access to the variables and functions inside the inner function.

Also, the inner function can be invoked only by the parent function.

Lexical scope in JavaScript function
In JavaScript, lexical scope refers to the way in which the variables, functions, and objects in a program are associated with specific scopes, or regions of the code where they are accessible. Each function in JavaScript has its own scope, which is determined by the location of the function in the code, and the scopes of any parent functions that contain it.

Here's an example of lexical scope in JavaScript:

let globalVariable = 'I am a global variable';

    function outerFunction() {
      let outerVariable = 'I am a variable in the outer function';

      function innerFunction() {
        let innerVariable = 'I am a variable in the inner function';
        console.log(globalVariable); // Output: "I am a global variable"
        console.log(outerVariable); // Output: "I am a variable in the outer function"
        console.log(innerVariable); // Output: "I am a variable in the inner function"
      }

    innerFunction();
    }
    outerFunction();
In this example, the innerFunction has access to variables in the outerFunction scope and global scope. However, the outerFunction doesn't have access to the variables in the innerFunction scope.

JavaScript uses a scope chain to determine which variables are accessible in a particular scope. The scope chain starts with the local scope and then moves up to the parent scope, and so on, until it reaches the global scope.

JavaScript has a lexical scoping which means that the scope of a variable is defined by its location in the code, and not by its execution context.Understanding lexical scope is an important part of understanding how JavaScript works and can help you write more efficient and effective code.

        <summary>Understanding Block Scope and Function Scope in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript has two types of scope: block scope and function scope. Understanding the difference between the two can help you write better, more maintainable code.

Block scope refers to variables declared within a block using the let or const keyword. These variables are only accessible within that block and any nested blocks. A block is defined as any section of code enclosed by curly braces {}.

For example

if (true) {
  let blockScopeVariable = 'I am a variable with block scope';
  console.log(blockScopeVariable); // Output: "I am a variable with block scope"
}
console.log(blockScopeVariable); // ReferenceError: blockScopeVariable is not defined
Function scope refers to variables declared within a function using the var keyword (or no keyword at all). These variables are only accessible within that function and any nested functions.

For example

function myFunction() {
  var functionScopeVariable = 'I am a variable with function scope';
  console.log(functionScopeVariable); // Output: "I am a variable with function scope"
}
console.log(functionScopeVariable); // ReferenceError: functionScopeVariable is not defined

In this example, the variable functionScopeVariable is only accessible within the myFunction function.

It's important to note that block scope is introduced with let and const in ECMAScript 6 (ES6)and it's now the preferred way for declaring variables in javascript.

Here's an example to demonstrate the difference between block scope and function scope in JavaScript:

function myFunction() {
  if(true){
    let fullname="Joes";
    console.log(fullname);
  }
  console.log(fullname);
}
myFunction()
In this example, the variable fullname is defined as a block scope variable and is only accessible within the block it is declared in. When the console.log(fullname) statement is executed inside the if block, it correctly outputs "Joes". However, when the console.log(fullname) statement is executed outside of the if block, it raises a ReferenceError, because the variable fullname is not defined in that scope.

function myFunction() {
  if(true){
    var fullname="Joes";
    console.log(fullname);
  }
  console.log(fullname);
}
myFunction()
In this example, the variable fullname is defined as a function scope variable and is accessible within the entire function. When the console.log(fullname) statement is executed inside the if block, it correctly outputs "Joes". When the console.log(fullname) statement is executed outside of the if block, it correctly outputs "Joes" too, because the variable fullname is defined in the function scope.

Using the appropriate scope for your variables can help prevent naming conflicts, improve the readability of your code, and make it easier to debug issues. As a general rule of thumb, use let and const for block scope variables and avoid using varas it can lead to unexpected behavior.

In conclusion, understanding the difference between block scope and function scope in JavaScript is crucial to writing maintainable and efficient code.

Block scope variables, declared with the let or const keyword, are only accessible within the block they are defined in and any nested blocks. Function scope variables, declared with the var keyword, are only accessible within the function they are defined in and any nested functions. It is recommended to use block scope variables (let, const) instead of function scope variables (var) as it can prevent naming conflicts and improve the readability of the code.

        <summary>Understanding the Differences between Rest Parameter Functions and Spread Operators in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript is a powerful programming language that provides many features and tools to make coding easier and more efficient. Two of these features are the rest parameter function and the spread operator, which are similar in that they both handle multiple arguments, but have different uses and syntax.

A rest parameter function is used to accept an arbitrary number of arguments as an array. The rest parameter is defined by three dots (...) followed by the parameter name.

For example

function myFunction(first, second, ...rest) {
  console.log(first);
  console.log(second);
  console.log(rest);
}

In this example, the function "myFunction" takes three arguments: "first", "second", and "rest". "rest" is a rest parameter, and it will collect all the remaining arguments into an array.

On the other hand, the spread operator is used to expand an iterable (such as an array or string) into individual elements. The spread operator is defined by three dots (...) and can be used in function calls, array literals, and object literals. For example:

let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let newArray = [...myArray, 4, 5];
console.log(newArray);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In this example, the spread operator is used to expand the elements of "myArray" into a new array "newArray".

In summary, the rest parameter function and the spread operator are both useful tools in JavaScript for handling multiple arguments, but they have different uses and syntax. The rest parameter function is used to gather remaining arguments into an array, while the spread operator is used to spread elements of an array or iterable. Understanding the differences between these two features can help you write cleaner, more efficient code.

        <summary>Exploring the Power of Parameter Destructuring in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript offers a powerful feature called "parameter destructuring" that allows developers to extract specific properties from an object or elements from an array and assign them to individual variables when defining a function's parameters. This results in more concise and readable code, and can make our development process more efficient.

Let's start by looking at an example of destructuring an object. Suppose we have a person object that contains a name and an age property:

const person = {name: 'Joes', age: 30};
Instead of accessing the properties of this object using dot notation or bracket notation, we can destructure the object's properties directly into variables. Here's an example of a function that takes a single argument, an object, and destructures its name property to say hello:

function sayHello({ name }) {
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello(person); // Output: "Hello, Joes!"

We can also set default values for properties when destructuring if the property is not present in the object.

const person = { name: 'Joes'};

function sayHello({ name, age = 25 }) {
console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old`);
}

sayHello(person); // Output: "Hello, Joes! You are 25 years old"
Similarly, we can destructure an array's elements into variables. Consider the following example of a function that takes an array of numbers and adds them together:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

function add([a, b, c]) {
  return a + b + c;
}

console.log(add(numbers)); // Output: 6
We can also use the rest operator to collect remaining properties in a single variable.

const person = {name: 'Joes', age: 30, city: 'Salem', country: 'India'};

function sayHello({ name, age ,...rest) {
console.log (`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old`);
  console.log(rest);
}

sayHello(person); // Output: "Hello, Joes! You are 30 years old" and {city: 'Salem', country: 'India'}
In conclusion, parameter destructuring is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows developers to extract specific properties from an object or elements from an array and assign them to individual variables when defining a function's parameters. This results in more concise and readable code, and can make our development process more efficient. It is a great tool to have in your toolbox as a JavaScript developer.

        <summary>Understanding and Using Callback Functions in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that offers many ways to structure and organize code. One such technique is the use of callback functions. In this blog post, we will explore what callback functions are, how they are used, and some common use cases.

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. The function that receives the callback function as an argument is often referred to as a higher-order function. When the higher-order function is called, it can execute the callback function that was passed as an argument, allowing for greater flexibility and reusability of code.

Here is an example of a higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument:

function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
  // some code
callback();
  // some code
}
The callback function can then be passed as an argument when the higher-order function is called:

function myCallback() {
console.log("I am a callback function");
}

higherOrderFunction(myCallback);
// Output: "I am a callback function"
One of the main use cases for callback functions is event handling. For example, you can pass a callback function as an argument to an event listener, allowing for specific actions to be taken when a specific event occurs, such as a button click or form submission.

Another common use case is for asynchronous operations. Callback functions can be passed as arguments to asynchronous functions, such as setTimeout() or XMLHttpRequest, allowing for specific actions to be taken once the asynchronous operation is complete.

A simple example of a callback function is the setTimeout() function, which is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to execute a function after a specified amount of time has passed. The setTimeout() function takes two arguments: a callback function and a time delay (in milliseconds):

setTimeout(function() {
console.log('Hello, world!');
}, 1000); // Output: "Hello, world!" after 1 second
Callback functions are also commonly used in iteration, for example, forEach() or map() methods in JavaScript, to allow for specific actions to be taken on each element of an array for example

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

numbers.forEach(function(number) {
  console.log(number);
}); // Output: 1 2 3
In React, a common pattern is to use higher-order components (HOCs) that take a component as an argument and return a new component with additional functionality. The original component is passed as a callback function to the HOC.

Lastly, callback functions can also be used for partial application, allowing to "fix" or "partial apply" some of the arguments of a function, creating a new function with less arguments.

In conclusion, callback functions are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code. By understanding how to use callback functions, you can write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

        <summary>Understanding and Using Closure Functions in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript is a powerful programming language that allows developers to write elegant and efficient code. One of the key features of the language is the ability to create closure functions, also known as inner functions that have access to the variables in the scope in which they were defined, even after that scope has closed. This technique is known as closure.

A closure is a function that has access to the variables in the scope in which it was defined, even after that scope has closed. This can be achieved by returning a function that closes over the variables in its scope.

Here is an example of a closure function:

function outerFunction(x) {
  return function innerFunction(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

const addFive = outerFunction(5);
console.log(addFive(3)); // 8
In the example above, the outerFunction takes an argument x and returns an innerFunction that takes another argument y. The innerFunction has access to the variable x from the scope of the outerFunction, and it returns the sum of x and y.

We can also save the returned inner function to a variable and call it with different arguments. This is useful in many cases like creating a set of utility functions that have some shared state or configuration.

Here is an example of a closure function:

function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return count++;
  }
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 0
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
In this example, the createCounter function returns an inner function that closes over the variable count. Every time the inner function is called, it returns the current value of count, and then increments it by 1.

Closures are also commonly used in JavaScript libraries and frameworks for creating specific behavior and functionality, such as creating private variables and methods in objects and classes. Closures can also be used to create functional programming patterns, such as currying and partial application.

In conclusion, closure functions, also known as inner functions, are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow for greater flexibility and reusability of code. By understanding how to use closure functions, developers can create utility functions, encapsulation and also write more elegant and efficient code.

        <summary>Exploring the forEach method in JavaScript: More Examples</summary>
        <pre>
            The forEach method in JavaScript is a powerful tool for iterating over arrays. It allows you to apply a callback function to each element in an array, making it a great option for performing actions such as filtering, printing, or manipulating elements. In this blog post, we'll take a look at ten practical examples of using the forEach method to work with arrays in JavaScript.

1. Example of using the forEach method to print each element of an array:

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log(fruit));
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the fruits array and print each element. The callback function takes the current element as an argument, and simply logs it to the console.

2. Example of using the forEach method to sum all elements of an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let total = 0;
numbers.forEach(number => {
  total += number;
});
console.log(total); // 15
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the numbers array and sum all the elements. The callback function takes the current element and adds it to the total variable, which is initially set to 0.

3. Example of using the forEach method to create a new array from an existing one:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = [];
numbers.forEach(number => {
doubledNumbers.push(number * 2);
});
console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the numbers array and create a new array containing the double of each element. The callback function takes the current element, multiplies it by 2 and then pushes it to the new array.

4. Example of using the forEach method to find the max element of an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let max = numbers[0];
numbers.forEach(number => {
  if (number > max) {
    max = number;
  }
});
console.log(max); // 5
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the numbers array and find the max element. The callback function takes the current element and compares it with the max variable. If the current element is greater than max, it updates the max variable.

5. Example of using the forEach method to calculate the average of an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let total = 0;
let count = 0;
numbers.forEach(number => {
  total += number;
  count++;
});
console.log(total / count); // 3
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the numbers array and calculate the average. The callback function takes the current element and adds it to the total variable, and increments the count variable. After the loop, the total and count variables are used to calculate the average.

6. Example of using the forEach method to filter an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = [];
numbers.forEach(number => {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
evenNumbers.push(number);
  }
});
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the numbers array and filter out the even numbers. The callback function takes the current element, checks if it is divisible by 2 and if it is, it pushes the element to the evenNumbers array.

7. Example of using the forEach method to update elements of an array:

const names = ['John', 'Mike', 'Bob', 'Jane'];
names.forEach((name, index) => {
  names[index] = name.toUpperCase();
});
console.log(names); // ['JOHN', 'MIKE', 'BOB', 'JANE']
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the names array and update each element to uppercase. The callback function takes the current element and its index, and updates the element at that index position to uppercase.

8. Example of using the forEach method to to remove elements from an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
numbers.forEach((number, index) => {
  if (number > 5) {
numbers.splice(index, 1);
  }
});
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the numbers array and remove elements greater than 5. The callback function takes the current element and its index, and checks if the element is greater than 5, if it is it uses the splice method to remove that element from the array.

9. Example of using the forEach method to check if an element exists in an array:

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
let exists = false;
fruits.forEach(fruit => {
  if (fruit === 'banana') {
    exists = true;
  }
});
console.log(exists); // true
In this example, the forEach method is used to iterate over the fruits array and check if the element 'banana' exists in the array. The callback function takes the current element and compares it with 'banana', if they are equal it sets the exists variable to true.

10. Example of using the forEach method to check concat array element:

const words = ["hello", "world"];
let concat = "";
words.forEach(word => {
concat += word + " ";
});
console.log(concat); // "hello world "
In this example, we have an array of words and we are using the forEach method to iterate through the array and concatenate each word to a variable called "concat". Once the forEach loop is completed, we log the value of "concat" to the console and it should print "hello world ", which is the concatenation of all words in the array.

In conclusion, the forEach method is a powerful tool in JavaScript for iterating through an array and performing a specific action on each element. It is a more concise and readable way of performing operations on arrays compared to traditional for and while loops. The forEach method does not return a new array and does not stop when it encounters a return statement or throws an error, unlike other looping methods. However, it can be used in conjunction with other array methods such as map, filter, and reduce to perform more complex operations on arrays. It's a very useful method to have in your tool belt as a JavaScript developer, and it's important to be familiar with its syntax and usage.

        <summary>Unleashing the Power of the filter() Method in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide</summary>
        <pre>
            The filter() method in JavaScript is a built-in method of the Array object that allows you to create a new array with all elements that pass a certain test. The test is implemented by a callback function that you provide as an argument to the filter() method. The callback function is called for each element of the original array, and if it returns true, the element is included in the new array. If it returns false, the element is excluded from the new array.

A closure is a function that has access to the variables in the scope in which it was defined, even after that scope has closed. This can be achieved by returning a function that closes over the variables in its scope.

Here's the general syntax for using the filter() method:

var newArray = originalArray.filter(function(element, index, array) {
  // test the element and return true or false
});
The callback function takes three arguments:

element: the current element being processed
index: the index of the current element
array: the original array
1. Filtering an array of numbers to only include even numbers:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
2. Filtering an array of objects to only include those with a certain property value:

let user = [
{ name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
{ name: 'Bob', age: 30 },
{ name: 'Charlie', age: 35 }
];
let eligible = people.filter(person =>person.age> 30);
console.log(eligible); // [{ name: 'Charlie', age: 35 }]
3. Filtering an array of strings to only include those of a certain length:

let words = ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'fish', 'giraffe'];
let wordsWithFourLetters = words.filter(word =>word.length === 4);
console.log(wordsWithFourLetters); // ['fish']
4. Filtering an array of numbers to only include those that are divisible by 3:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
let numbersDivisibleBy3 = numbers.filter(number => number % 3 === 0);
console.log(numbersDivisibleBy3); // [3, 6, 9]
5. Filtering an array of objects to only include those with a specific value:

let items = [
{ name: "apple", category: "fruit" },
{ name: "carrot", category: "vegetable" },
{ name: "banana", category: "fruit" }
];
let fruits = items.filter(item =>item.category === "fruit");
console.log(fruits); 
// [{ name: "apple", category: "fruit" }, { name: "banana", category: "fruit" }]
6. Filtering an array of strings to only include those that start with a specific letter:

let words = ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'fish', 'giraffe'];
let wordsStartsWithE = words.filter(word =>word.startsWith('e'));
console.log(wordsStartsWithE); // ['elephant']
7. Filtering an array of objects to only include those with a certain property value:

let products = [
{ name: 'apple', price: 1.2 },
{ name: 'orange', price: 2.5 },
{ name: 'banana', price: 3.5 }
];
let expensiveProducts = products.filter(product =>product.price> 2);
console.log(expensiveProducts); 
// [{ name: 'orange', price: 2.5 },{ name: 'banana', price: 3.5 }]

8. Filtering an array of objects to only include those that are enabled:

let buttons = [
        { name: 'Save', enabled: true },
        { name: 'Delete', enabled:false },
        { name: 'Cancel', enabled: true },
        { name: 'Submit', enabled: false }
    ];
    let enabledButtons = buttons.filter(button =>button.enabled === true);
    console.log(enabledButtons);
    // [{ name: 'Save', enabled: true }, { name: 'Cancel', enabled: true }]
9. Filtering an array of numbers to only include those greater than a certain value:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
let numbersGreaterThan5 = numbers.filter(number => number > 5);
console.log(numbersGreaterThan5); // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

10. Filtering an array of strings to only include those that contain a specific substring:

let words = ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'fish', 'giraffe'];
let wordsWithE = words.filter(word =>word.includes('e'));
console.log(wordsWithE); // ['elephant', 'giraffe']
11. Filtering an array of objects based on multiple conditions: Category Fruit and Price > 100

const products = [
    { name: 'Apple', category: 'fruit', price: 100 },
    { name: 'Carrot', category: 'vegetable', price: 50 },
    { name: 'Orange', category: 'fruit', price: 120 },
    { name: 'Broccoli', category: 'vegetable', price: 75 },
    { name: 'Mango', category: 'fruit', price: 110 }
];
12. Filtering an array of objects based on a search term:

let books=[
    { title: 'Eloquent JavaScript', author: 'Marijn Haverbeke', year: 2011 },
    { title: 'JavaScript: The Good Parts', author: 'Douglas Crockford', year: 2008 },
    { title: 'Learning Web Design: A Beginner\'s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics', author: 'Jennifer Niederst Robbins', year: 2012 },
    { title: 'HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites', author: 'Jon Duckett', year: 2011 },
    { title: 'CSS Secrets: Better Solutions to Everyday Web Design Problems', author: 'Lea Verou', year: 2015 },
    { title: 'JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development', author: 'Jon Duckett', year: 2014 },
    { title: 'You Don\'t Know JS', author: 'Kyle Simpson', year: '2014-2019' },
    { title: 'React: Up & Running', author: 'Stoyan Stefanov', year: 2016 },
    { title: 'Node.js Design Patterns', author: 'Mario Casciaro', year: 2014 },
    { title: 'Head First Design Patterns', author: 'Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson', year: 2004 }
];
In addition, filter() always returns a new array and does not modify the original array. It does not change the length of the original array and does not change the index of the elements.

Conclusion

The filter() method is a powerful tool for manipulating arrays in JavaScript. With a little bit of creativity, you can use it to solve a wide variety of problems. The examples in this blog post should give you a good starting point for using the filter() method in your own code.

Remember to always check the documentation and play around with different examples to get a better understanding of how it works. With practice, you'll be able to filter arrays like a pro!

        <summary>Exploring the Power of map in JavaScript: 10 Examples to Transform Your Arrays
        </summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript provides several ways to manipulate and transform arrays, but one of the most popular and widely used methods is map.The map() method is used to create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. The map() method does not modify the original array, but instead, it creates a new array with the modified elements. The function passed to map() is called for each element in the array, and it takes three arguments: the current value, the current index, and the entire array. The map() method is commonly used to transform an array of data into a new format, such as converting an array of numbers into an array of strings.

In this article, we'll take a closer look at map and provide 10 examples to help you master this powerful method.

1.Simple Transformation

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
In this example, we're using map to iterate through an array of numbers and double each one. The resulting array, "doubledNumbers" contains the transformed values.

2.Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array, squared.

Example Input:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
Solution:
function getEvenSquaredNumbers(numbers) {
  const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
  const squaredNumbers = evenNumbers.map(num => num ** 2);
  return squaredNumbers;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const result = getEvenSquaredNumbers(numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: [4, 16, 36]
3. Modifying Array Elements

const words = ["hello", "world"];
const capitalizedWords = words.map(word =>word.toUpperCase());
console.log(capitalizedWords); // ["HELLO", "WORLD"]
In this example, we're using map to iterate through an array of words and capitalizing each one. The resulting array, "capitalizedWords", contains the transformed values.

4.Given an array of objects representing books, create a new array containing the book titles and authors in the format "Title by Author".

Example Input:
const books = [
  {
    title: 'The Great Gatsby',
    author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald'
  },
  {
    title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee'
  },
  {
    title: 'Pride and Prejudice',
    author: 'Jane Austen'
  }
];
Solution:
const bookTitlesAndAuthors = books.map(book => `${book.title} by ${book.author}`);
console.log(bookTitlesAndAuthors);
// Output:
// [
//   "The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald",
//   "To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee",
//   "Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen"
// ]
5. Given an array of temperatures in Celsius, convert each temperature to Fahrenheit.

Example Input:
const celsiusTemperatures = [25, 30, 15, 10];
Solution:
const fahrenheitTemperatures = celsiusTemperatures.map(temp => (temp * 9/5) + 32);
console.log(fahrenheitTemperatures);
// Output: [77, 86, 59, 50]
6. Combining Arrays

const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
const colors = ["red", "yellow"];
const fruitColors = fruits.map((fruit, index) => fruit + "-" + colors[index]);
console.log(fruitColors); // ["apple-red", "banana-yellow"]
In this example, we're using map to combine elements from two different arrays, "fruits" and "colors", into a new array "fruitColors".

7. Creating a new Array

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * num);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
In this example, we're using map to create a new array of the squared values of numbers.

8. Filtering an Array

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.map(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // [false, true, false, true, false]
In this example, we're using map to filter an array, so that only even numbers remain.

9. Extracting Properties from an Array of Objects

const users = [
{ name: "Ram", age: 30 },
{ name: "Sam", age: 25 },
{ name: "Ravi", age: 35 }
];
const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names); // ["Ram", "Sam", "Ravi"]
In this example, we're using map to extract the "name" property from an array of objects.

10. Modifying an Array of Objects

const users = [
{ name: "Ram", age: 30 },
{ name: "Sam", age: 25 },
{ name: "Ravi", age: 35 }
];
const updatedUsers = users.map(user => {
    return {
        ...user,
        age: user.age + 1
    }
});
console.log(updatedUsers);
// [{ name: "Ram", age: 31 }, { name: "Sam", age: 26 }, { name: "Ravi", age: 36 }]
In this example, we're using map to iterate through an array of objects and increase the "age" property by one. The resulting array "updatedUsers" contains the transformed objects.

11. Given an array of strings, create a new array with the lengths of each string.

Example Input:
const strings = ['hello', 'world', 'javascript'];
Solution:
const stringLengths = strings.map(str => str.length);
console.log(stringLengths);
// Output: [5, 5, 10]
12. Given an array of objects representing students, create a new array with their full names.

Example Input:
const students = [
  { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' },
  { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Smith' },
  { firstName: 'Mike', lastName: 'Johnson' }
];
Solution:
const fullNames = students.map(student => `${student.firstName} ${student.lastName}`);
console.log(fullNames);
// Output: ["John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Mike Johnson"]
13. Flattening an Array

const nestedArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
const flattenedArray = nestedArray.map(subArray =>subArray.join(''));
console.log(flattenedArray); // ["12", "34", "56"]
In this example, we're using map to flatten an array of nested arrays. The resulting array "flattenedArray" contains the transformed values.

14. Formatting a Date Array

const dates = [
    new Date("2022-01-01"),
    new Date("2022-02-01"),
    new Date("2022-03-01")
];
const formattedDates = dates.map(date =>date.toLocaleDateString());
console.log(formattedDates); // ["1/1/2022", "2/1/2022", "3/1/2022"]
In this example, we're using map to iterate through an array of date objects and format them using the toLocaleDateString() method. The resulting array "formattedDates" contains the transformed values.

15. Creating an Array of DOM Elements

const names = ["Ram", "Sam", "Ravi"];
const nameElements = names.map(name => {
    const nameElement = document.createElement("div");
nameElement.innerText = name;
    return nameElement;
});
console.log(nameElements);
In this example, we're using map to create an array of DOM elements using the createElement() method. The resulting array "nameElements" contains the transformed elements.

16. Suppose you have an array of objects representing different currencies with their exchange rates to USD. You want to convert an amount from one currency to another using the exchange rates.

Example Input:
const currencies = [
  { currency: 'USD', rate: 1 },
  { currency: 'EUR', rate: 0.85 },
  { currency: 'GBP', rate: 0.73 },
  { currency: 'JPY', rate: 109.97 }
];
const amount = 100; // Amount in USD
const targetCurrency = 'EUR';
Solution:
const convertedAmounts = currencies.map(currency => {
  const convertedAmount = amount * currency.rate;
  return { currency: currency.currency, amount: convertedAmount };
});

console.log(convertedAmounts);
// Output: [
//   { currency: 'USD', amount: 100 },
//   { currency: 'EUR', amount: 85 },
//   { currency: 'GBP', amount: 73 },
//   { currency: 'JPY', amount: 10997 }
// ]

Example Input:
const phoneNumbers = ['1234567890', '9876543210', '5551234567'];
Solution:
const formattedNumbers = phoneNumbers.map(number => {
  const formattedNumber = `(${number.slice(0, 3)}) ${number.slice(3, 6)}-${number.slice(6)}`;
  return formattedNumber;
});

console.log(formattedNumbers);
// Output: ["(123) 456-7890", "(987) 654-3210", "(555) 123-4567"]
18. Filtering and Mapping Data - Suppose you have an array of objects representing products, and you want to filter out products with a certain condition and create a new array with specific properties.

Example Input:
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: 'iPhone', price: 999, category: 'Electronics' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Shirt', price: 25, category: 'Fashion' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Book', price: 15, category: 'Books' },
  { id: 4, name: 'TV', price: 799, category: 'Electronics' },
];
Solution:
const filteredProducts = products
  .filter(product => product.category === 'Electronics' && product.price > 500)
  .map(product => ({ id: product.id, name: product.name }));

console.log(filteredProducts);
// Output: [
//   { id: 1, name: 'iPhone' },
//   { id: 4, name: 'TV' }
// ]

//   { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', email: 'jane@example.com' },
//   { id: 3, name: 'Mike Johnson', email: 'mike@example.com' }
// ]
20. Calculating Item Totals - Suppose you have an array of objects representing items in a shopping cart, and you want to calculate the total price for each item by multiplying the quantity and price.

Example Input:
const cartItems = [
  { name: 'Shirt', price: 20, quantity: 2 },
  { name: 'Pants', price: 30, quantity: 1 },
  { name: 'Shoes', price: 50, quantity: 1 }
];
Solution:
const itemTotals = cartItems.map(item => ({
  name: item.name,
  total: item.price * item.quantity
}));

console.log(itemTotals);
// Output: [
//   { name: 'Shirt', total: 40 },
//   { name: 'Pants', total: 30 },
//   { name: 'Shoes', total: 50 }
// ]
Conclusion

The map() method in JavaScript is a powerful and versatile tool for working with arrays. It allows you to easily transform and manipulate the elements of an array without modifying the original data. The map() method is a great choice when you need to create a new array with modified elements, such as converting an array of numbers into an array of strings or extracting specific information from an array of objects. Additionally, the map() method is also useful when you want to perform the same operation on each element of an array, such as incrementing every number in an array by 1. With the map() method, you can easily and efficiently work with arrays in JavaScript.

        <summary> Reducing Arrays to a Single Value By Using the reduce() Method in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>The reduce() method in JavaScript is a powerful array method that allows you to iterate through an array and reduce it to a single value. This method can be used for a variety of tasks such as summing the values of an array, flattening an array, or counting the occurrences of an element.

            The syntax for the reduce() method in JavaScript is as follows:
            
            array.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) {
              // code to be executed on each iteration
            }, initialValue);
            array : is the array on which the reduce() method is being called.
            function(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) : is the callback function that is executed on each iteration. It takes four arguments:
            accumulator : is the accumulated value that is returned on each iteration. It starts with the initialValue (if provided) or the first element of the array (if no initialValue is provided)
            currentValue : is the current element of the array that is being processed.
            currentIndex : is the index of the current element of the array that is being processed.
            array : is the array on which the reduce() method is being called.
            initialValue(optional) : is the starting value for the accumulator. If no initialValue is provided, the first element of the array is used as the starting value.
            The reduce() method returns a single value that is the result of executing the callback function on each element of the array.
            
            Example 1: Summing the values of an array
            
            let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
            let sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
            console.log(sum); // 15
            In this example, we use the reduce() method to sum the values of an array of numbers. The accumulator starts at the first element of the array and the currentValue is the next element. We use the accumulator to store the sum and add the currentValue to it on each iteration.
            
            Example 2: Flattening an array
            
            let nestedArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
            let flattenedArray = nestedArray.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =>accumulator.concat(currentValue));
            console.log(flattenedArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
            In this example, we use the reduce() method to flatten an array of arrays. We use the concat() method to merge the currentValue (which is an array) into the accumulator which is also an array).
            
            Example 3: Counting the occurrences of an element
            
            let colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow'];
            let colorCounts = colors.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
              if (currentValue in accumulator) {
                accumulator[currentValue]++;
              } else {
                accumulator[currentValue] = 1;
              }
              return accumulator;
            }, {});
            console.log(colorCounts); // { red: 2, blue: 2, green: 1, yellow: 1 }
            In this example, we use the reduce() method to count the occurrences of each element in an array. We use an object as the accumulator and check if the currentValue already exists in the object. If it does, we increment the value by 1. If it doesn't, we add the currentValue as a key to the object and set its value to 1.
            
            Example 4: Finding the largest value in an array
            
            let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];
            let largest = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
              return Math.max(accumulator, currentValue);
            });
            console.log(largest); // 25
            In this example, we use the reduce() method to find the largest value in an array of numbers. We use the Math.max() method to compare the accumulator and the currentValue on each iteration and return the larger value. The final value returned by the reduce() method is the largest value in the array.
            
            Example 5: Grouping elements by a certain property
            
            let people = [
            { name: 'Rakesh', age: 25, city: 'Chennai' },
            { name: 'Raj', age: 30, city: 'Salem' },
            { name: 'Sara', age: 35, city: 'Chennai' }
            ];
            
            let groupedByCity = people.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
              if (currentValue.city in accumulator) {
            accumulator[currentValue.city].push(currentValue);
              } else {
            accumulator[currentValue.city] = [currentValue];
              }
              return accumulator;
            }, {});
            
            console.log(groupedByCity); 
            /* 
            { 
            Chennai: [{ name: 'Rakesh', age: 25, city: 'Chennai' }, { name: 'Sara', age: 35, city: 'Chennai' }], 
            Salem: [{ name: 'Raj', age: 30, city: 'Salem' }] 
            }
            */
            Conclusion
            
            The reduce() method in JavaScript is a powerful tool for working with arrays. It allows for the iteration and calculation of values within an array, making it easy to perform tasks such as summing or finding the product of all elements in an array. The reduce() method takes a callback function as an argument, which is used to specify the calculation to be performed on each element of the array. The callback function takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current value. The accumulator is used to store the result of the calculation as the function iterates through the array. The initial value for the accumulator can be provided or it takes the first element of the array as the starting value. Overall, the reduce() method is a useful and versatile tool for working with arrays in JavaScript.

        <summary>Navigating Complex Data Structures with Optional Chaining in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            Optional chaining is a feature introduced in JavaScript ES2020 that allows developers to access properties of an object without having to check if the object or its properties exist. It is represented by the ?. operator.

Here's an example of how optional chaining can be used:

const user={
    firstName:"Tutor",
    lastName:"Joes",
    address:{
        street:"Cherry Road",
        city:"salem",
        contact:"9043017689",
        }
}

console.log(user?.firstName);
console.log(user?.address?.contact);
In the given example, user is an object that has several properties, including firstName, lastName, and address. The two console.log statements are using the optional chaining operator (?.) to access the properties of the user object without having to check if they exist first.

The first console.log statement uses the optional chaining operator to access the firstName property of the user object. Since the firstName property exists, the statement will print the value of the property, which is "Tutor".

console.log(user?.firstName); // "Tutor"
The second console.log statement uses the optional chaining operator to access the contact property of the address object, which is a nested object inside the user object. Since the address and contact properties exist, the statement will print the value of the property, which is "9043017689".

console.log(user?.address?.contact); // "9043017689"
The optional chaining operator allows you to check if the objects and its properties exist without having to check them explicitly, which can make the code more concise and readable. If any of the properties or objects in the chain don't exist, the expression will return undefined instead of throwing a TypeError.

It's important to note that the optional chaining only applies to the part of the expression immediately to the right of the ?. operator, so if a property is accessed with the optional chaining operator and that property itself is undefined, the expression will still throw a TypeError.

In conclusion, optional chaining operator that allows developers to access properties of an object without having to check if the object or its properties exist. It is represented by the ?. operator and makes the code more concise and readable. By using the optional chaining operator, you can check if the objects and its properties exist without having to check them explicitly. If any of the properties or objects in the chain don't exist, the expression will return undefined instead of throwing a TypeError. It's a useful tool for working with complex data structures and can help prevent potential errors in your code.

        <summary>Function Inside Object in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, functions can be defined inside objects, just like any other property. These functions are called "methods" and can be invoked by using the object's name, followed by the method name and parentheses.

For example:

const object = {
    method: function() {
console.log("Hello, I'm a method!");
    }
};

object.method(); // prints "Hello, I'm a method!"
You can also define methods using the shorthand notation, which uses the function keyword.

const object = {
method() {
console.log("Hello, I'm a method!");
    }
};

object.method(); // prints "Hello, I'm a method!"
You can also define methods using the arrow function notation, which is similar to the shorthand notation but uses the => instead of function keyword

const object = {
    method: () => {
console.log("Hello, I'm a method!");
    }
};

object.method(); // prints "Hello, I'm a method!"
Inside the method, you can access the properties of the object using the this keyword.

const object = {
    property: "I'm a property",
    method: function() {
        console.log(this.property);
    }
};

object.method(); // prints "I'm a property"
Methods can also accept parameters and return values just like regular functions:

const object = {
    method: function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

console.log(object.method(1, 2)); // prints 3
You can also add methods to an object after it has been created by assigning a new method to an existing property, or by creating a new property on the object and assigning a method to it.

In javascript you can use class keyword to create objects with methods and properties, it follows the OOP concepts.

class Object {
constructor(){
this.property = "I'm a property";
    }
method(){
console.log("Hello, I'm a method!");
    }
}
const obj = new Object();
console.log(obj.property);
obj.method();
Overall, methods are an essential part of object-oriented programming in JavaScript and are a powerful tool for working with complex data structures.

function checkEligiblity(){
    if(this.age>=18){
        console.log(`${this.firstname} age is ${this.age} eligible for vote`);
    }else{
        console.log(`${this.firstname} age is ${this.age} not eligible for vote`);
    }
}

const user1={
    firstname:"Joes",
    age:35,
    eligiblity:checkEligiblity
}
user1.eligiblity();
const user2={
    firstname:"Sara",
    age:12,
    eligiblity:checkEligiblity
}
user2.eligiblity();
In JavaScript, it is common to define functions separately and then assign them to object properties as methods. In the above example, the function checkEligibility is defined separately and then assigned to the eligibility property of the user1 and user2 objects. This allows the function to be reused as a method for multiple objects.

When the method is invoked on the user1 object, this inside the method will refer to user1 object and when it is invoked on the user2 object, this inside the method will refer to user2 object, This way checkEligibility function can use the properties of the current object on which it is invoked.

In the example, user1.eligibility() is invoked, and it will execute the checkEligibility function. Inside the function, it uses the this keyword to access the properties of the user1 object, namely firstname and age. The function then checks if the person's age is greater than or equal to 18, and if so, logs a message saying that the person is eligible to vote.

Similarly, when user2.eligibility() is invoked, it will execute the checkEligibility function. Inside the function, it uses the this keyword to access the properties of the user2 object, namely firstname and age. The function then checks if the person's age is greater than or equal to 18, and if not, logs a message saying that the person is not eligible to vote.

In this way, the function checkEligibility is used as a method for different objects and it uses the this keyword to access the properties of the object that invokes it, making the function more reusable.

        <summary>Mastering the call, apply, and bind Methods in JavaScript: A Deep Dive</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, the call, apply, and bind methods are used to change the this context of a function.

The call method is used to invoke a function and specify the this context. It takes an object as its first argument, which becomes the this context for the function, followed by any additional arguments for the function.

For example:

function total(eng,mat) {
console.log(this.name+" got "+(eng+mat)+" Marks");
}

const user = { name: 'Ram' };
total.call(user, 65,75); // Ram got 140 Marks
The apply method is similar to call, but it takes an array of arguments for the function, instead of a list of arguments.

For example:

function total(eng,mat) {
console.log(this.name+" got "+(eng+mat)+" Marks");
}

const user = { name: 'Ram' };
total.apply(user, [65,75]); // Ram got 140 Marks
The bind method is used to create a new function with the this context set to the provided object. It takes an object as its first argument, which becomes the this context for the new function, and any additional arguments for the function are passed as arguments to the new function.

For example:

function total(eng,mat) {
console.log(this.name+" got "+(eng+mat)+" Marks");
}

const user = { name: 'Ram' };
const fun=total.bind(user, 65,75);
fun();// Ram got 140 Marks
In this way, call, apply and bind methods are used to change the this context of a function, which allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code.

In conclusion, understanding and mastering the use of the call, apply, and bind methods in JavaScript is an important aspect of object-oriented programming. These methods allow you to change the this context of a function, enabling greater flexibility and reusability of code. With the ability to invoke a function with a specific context, pass an array of arguments, and create a new function with a pre-defined context, you will be able to write more efficient and maintainable code. Understanding these methods is essential for any JavaScript developer who wants to take their skills to the next level.

        <summary>Understanding the this keyword in JavaScript Arrow Functions: A Guide</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript is a powerful and versatile language, with a lot of features and concepts to master. One of the most important concepts to understand is the this keyword. In this blog post, we will dive into how the this keyword works inside arrow functions and how it differs from regular functions.

In JavaScript, the this keyword inside a function refers to the object that the function is a property of or the object that the function is called on. However, the behavior of the this keyword inside an arrow function is different from regular functions.

In an arrow function, the this keyword is lexically scoped, meaning it takes on the value of the this keyword in the surrounding code. The this keyword in an arrow function does not get rebound when the function is invoked, unlike regular functions. It keeps the same value as the this keyword in the surrounding code.

For example:

const obj = {
  name: 'John',
printName: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

obj.printName(); //undefined
In this example, the this keyword inside the arrow function refers to the this of the global scope, which is undefined because the name property is not defined on the global object.

Another example:

const obj = {
  name: 'John',
printName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
printNameWithArrow: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

obj.printName(); //John
obj.printNameWithArrow(); //undefined
In this example, the printName function will output 'John' because this keyword refers to the obj object. But printNameWithArrow function will output undefined because it has not access to obj object this keyword.

Because of this behavior, arrow functions are not suitable for methods that need to be bound to a specific object, and they can't be used as constructors, or with new keyword.

Conclusion :

It's important to keep in mind that arrow functions' behavior with this keyword is different from regular functions. This means that if you want to use the this keyword inside a function, you should use a regular function instead of an arrow function. Understanding the this keyword in arrow functions is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code in JavaScript. With this knowledge, you can make better use of JavaScript's powerful features and write more robust and readable code.

            When programming in JavaScript, one of the key concepts is object-oriented programming. Objects allow you to store data and functions in a structured way, making it easier to organize your code and access your data. There are many ways to create objects in JavaScript, but in this blog post, we will explore three popular approaches.

Code 1: Object Literal Notation
In JavaScript, the this keyword inside a function refers to the object that the function is a property of or the object that the function is called on. However, the behavior of the this keyword inside an arrow function is different from regular functions.

One way to create objects in JavaScript is using object literal notation. This approach involves defining the object properties and methods within curly braces. Here's an example:

const student = {
fullName: "Ram",
  father: "Sam",
  age: 12,
  address: "cherry road",
  city: "salem",
  about: function () {
    return `${this.fullName} is from ${this.city}`;
  },
  eligibility: function () {
    return this.age>= 18;
  },
};
This code creates a student object with several properties, including fullName, father, age, address, and city. It also has two methods, about and eligibility.

Code 2: Factory Function
Another approach to creating objects is using a factory function. This involves creating a function that returns a new object with the desired properties and methods. Here's an example:

const studentMethod = {
  about: function () {
    return `${this.fullName} is from ${this.city}`;
  },
  eligibility: function () {
    return this.age>= 18;
  },
};

function addStudent(fullName, father, age, address, city) {
  const user = {};
user.fullName = fullName;
user.father = father;
user.age = age;
user.age = age;
user.address = address;
user.city = city;
user.about = studentMethod.about;
user.eligibility = studentMethod.eligibility;
  return user;
}

console.log(addStudent("Sam", "Raja", 25, "Gandhi Road", "Salem"));
This code creates a function addStudent that takes in several parameters for the student's properties and then creates an empty object. The function then sets the object's properties and methods using the studentMethod object, which contains the shared methods.

Code 3: Prototype Inheritance
A third approach is using prototype inheritance. This involves creating a prototype object with shared methods and properties, and then creating new objects that inherit from the prototype. Here's an example:

const studentMethod = {
  about: function () {
    return `${this.fullName} is from ${this.city}`;
  },
  eligibility: function () {
    return this.age>= 18;
  },
};

function addStudent(fullName, father, age, address, city) {
  const user = Object.create(studentMethod);
user.fullName = fullName;
user.father = father;
user.age = age;
user.age = age;
user.address = address;
user.city = city;
  return user;
}

console.log(addStudent("Sam", "Raja", 25, "Gandhi Road", "Salem"));
This code is similar to Code 2, but it uses Object.create to create a new object that inherits from studentMethod. This means that the new object has access to all the methods and properties defined in studentMethod.

In summary, there are different ways to create objects in JavaScript, and each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Table below provides a quick comparison of the three approaches discussed in this blog post.

Approach	Advantages	Disadvantages
Object Literal Notation	Simple and easy to read	Does not allow for creating multiple instances
Factory Function	Allows for creating multiple instances with shared methods	Requires an extra function to create each instance
Prototype Inheritance	Allows for creating multiple instances with shared methods and avoids duplicating methods	Can be more complex to understand
In conclusion, choosing the right approach for creating objects in JavaScript depends on the requirements of your project and your own coding preferences. By understanding the different approaches and their tradeoffs, you can make informed decisions and write more efficient and effective code.

        <summary> Understanding Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
           
JavaScript is a popular programming language that supports object-oriented programming. One of the key features of object-oriented programming in JavaScript is Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance. Understanding how Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance works is essential to build efficient and scalable JavaScript applications.

Prototype is an object that serves as a template for other objects. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which allows the object to inherit properties and methods from the prototype. To access an object's prototype, you can use the prototype property. For example, to access the prototype of an object named "myObject," you can use the code "myObject.prototype".

Prototypal Inheritance is the mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. When you create a new object in JavaScript, it automatically inherits properties and methods from its prototype. You can add new properties and methods to an object's prototype using the prototype property. For example, if you want to add a new method to the prototype of an object named "myObject," you can use the code "myObject.prototype.newMethod = function(){}".

In JavaScript, every object is linked to a prototype chain. The prototype chain is a sequence of prototypes that an object inherits from. When you try to access a property or method of an object, JavaScript looks for that property or method in the object itself. If the property or method is not found in the object, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype. If the property or method is still not found, JavaScript continues to look for it in the prototype chain until it reaches the end of the chain, which is the Object.prototype object.

Using Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript can help you create more efficient and scalable code. By using prototypes, you can avoid duplicating code and create objects that share common properties and methods. Prototypal Inheritance allows you to create objects that inherit properties and methods from their prototypes, which can reduce the amount of code you need to write and make your code easier to maintain. Here are some examples that illustrate how prototype and prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript:

Example 1: Using Prototype to Add a Method to an Object

// Define a person object with a name property
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Add a greet method to the person object's prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}

// Create a new person object and call the greet method
var person = new Person("John");
person.greet(); // output: "Hello, my name is John"
In this example, we define a Person constructor function that creates a new object with a name property. We then use the prototype property to add a new greet method to the Person object's prototype. Finally, we create a new Person object and call the greet method, which outputs a greeting message with the person's name.

Example 2:

let obj1 = {
  name: "Joes",
  city: "salem",
  info: function () {
    return `${this.name} is from ${this.city}`;
  },
};

const obj2 = Object.create(obj1);
obj2.name = "Raja";
In the above code, we first define an object obj1 with three properties: name, city, and info. The info property is a method that returns a string containing the name and city properties. We then create a new object obj2 using the Object.create() method, with obj1 as its prototype. This means that obj2 inherits all properties and methods of obj1. In other words, obj2 is a new object that is linked to obj1 through its prototype chain.

Finally, we modify the name property of obj2 to be "Raja". This creates a new name property on obj2 that shadows the name property of obj1. When we access the name property of obj2, it returns "Raja", and when we access the name property of obj1, it returns "Joes".

Here's an example of how you can access the properties and methods of obj1 and obj2:

// Access the name property of obj1
console.log(obj1.name); // output: "Joes"

// Call the info method of obj1
console.log(obj1.info()); // output: "Joes is from salem"

// Access the name property of obj2
console.log(obj2.name); // output: "Raja"

// Call the info method of obj2, which inherits from obj1
console.log(obj2.info()); // output: "Raja is from salem"
As you can see, obj2 inherits the info method from obj1, and when we call it on obj2, it uses the name property of obj2 instead of obj1. This is an example of prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype chain.

Sample Working Codes :

let arr = ["apple", "orange"];
//console
arr.length;

let obj = {
  name: "Joes",
  city: "salem",
  info: function () {
    return `${this.name} from ${this.city}`;
  },
};
//console
obj.toString();

function myFunction() {}

/*
arr.__proto__
Array.prototype

All are object in JS

arr.__proto__.__proto__                     =>Object.prototype

arr.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__           => null

obj.__proto__                               =>Object.prototype
obj.__proto__.__proto__                     => null

myFunction.__proto__                        =>Function.prototype
myFunction.__proto__.__proto__              =>Object.prototype
myFunction.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__    => null


*/

let obj1 = {
  name: "Joes",
  city: "salem",
  info: function () {
    return `${this.name} is from ${this.city}`;
  },
};
/*
let obj2 = {
  name: "Raja",
};

//console
//obj2.__proto__

//obj2.__proto__ = obj1;

*/
const obj2 = Object.create(obj1);
obj2.name = "Raja";

//obj2.name;
//obj2.city;
//obj2.info();
obj2.city = "Chennai";
obj2.info();

Array.prototype.doubleLength = function () {
  return this.length * 2;
};

//arr.__proto__

Function.prototype.mybind = function () {
console.log("This is bind function in prototype");
};

function fun() {}

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
};

const alice = new Person("Alice");
const bob = new Person("Bob");

alice.greet(); // logs "Hello, my name is Alice."
bob.greet(); // logs "Hello, my name is Bob."
In conclusion, Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance are important concepts in JavaScript's object-oriented programming model. By understanding how prototypes work, you can create more efficient and scalable code, and by using prototypal inheritance, you can reduce the amount of code you need to write and make your code easier to maintain.

        <summary>Understanding Class and Inheritance in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that supports class and inheritance, allowing you to create reusable code and organize your program in a more efficient way. In this blog, we will dive into the concept of class and inheritance in JavaScript and show you how to implement them using ES5 and ES6 syntax.

Class and Inheritance in JavaScript
A class is a blueprint for creating objects that share common properties and methods. In JavaScript, a class is defined using the class keyword in ES6 or the function keyword in ES5. A class can have a constructor that is called when an object is created, and it can also have methods that define the behavior of the object.

Inheritance is a way of creating a new class from an existing class, called the parent or base class. The new class is called the child or derived class and inherits all the properties and methods of the parent class. In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved through the use of the prototype chain.

ES5 Example
Let's start with an example of a class and inheritance using ES5 syntax.

// Define parent class
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Add method to prototype
Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};

// Define child class that inherits from parent class
function Student(name, age) {
Person.call(this, name); // Call parent constructor with this instance
this.age = age;
}

// Set up prototype chain for inheritance
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

// Add method to child class
Student.prototype.eligiblity = function () {
console.log (this.name +" age is "+this.age +" " + (this.age>= 18? "Eligible”: "Not Eligable"));
};

// Create instances of classes
var person = new Person("Joes");
var student = new Student("Joes", 35);

// Call methods on instances
person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Joes
student.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Joes
student.eligiblity(); // Output: Joes age is 35 Eligible
Firstly, a parent class Person is defined with a constructor that accepts a name parameter and assigns it to a property with the same name. A method called sayHello() is added to the Person.prototype object, which logs a greeting with the name property of the instance.

Next, a child class Student is defined that inherits from the Person class. It accepts two parameters - name and age. It calls the parent constructor using Person.call(this, name) with this referring to the Student instance and assigns the age parameter to its own age property.

To set up the prototype chain for inheritance, Student.prototype is assigned an object created by calling Object.create(Person.prototype), which creates a new object with Person.prototype as its prototype. The Student.prototype.constructor is then set to Student to ensure that new Student instances can be created.

Finally, a method called eligibility() is added to the Student.prototype object. It checks if the age property is greater than or equal to 18 and logs a message with the student's name and eligibility status.

Two instances of classes are created - person using the Person constructor with the name "Joes" and student using the Student constructor with the name "Joes" and age 35.

Methods are then called on the instances. person.sayHello() logs "Hello, my name is Joes". student.sayHello() also logs "Hello, my name is Joes" because it inherits the sayHello() method from the Person class. student.eligibility() logs "Joes age is 35 Eligible" because the age property is greater than or equal to 18.

ES6 Example
Now let's see how the same class and inheritance can be implemented using ES6 syntax.

// Define parent class
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Add method to class
sayHello() {
console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

// Define child class that inherits from parent class
class Student extends Person {
constructor(name, age) {
    super(name); // Call parent constructor with this instance
this.age = age;
  }

  // Add method to child class
eligiblity() {
  console.log (this.name +" age is "+this.age +" " + (this.age>= 18? "Eligible”: "Not Eligable"));
 }
}

// Create instances of classes
let person = new Person("Joes");
let student = new Student("Joes", 35);

// Call methods on instances
person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Joes
student.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Joes
student.eligiblity(); // Output: Joes age is 35 Eligible
The code defines two classes in JavaScript, one parent class named Person and a child class named Student that inherits from the Person class.

The Person class is defined using the class keyword with a constructor method that sets the name property of the class. It also has a method called sayHello() which logs a message to the console that includes the name property of the class.

The Student class is defined using the extends keyword which tells JavaScript that this class inherits from the Person class. It has its own constructor method that takes two arguments name and age. The super() method is called in the Student constructor to call the constructor of the parent Person class with the name argument. The age property is then set on the Student instance.

The Student class also has its own method called eligiblity() which logs a message to the console. The message checks whether the age property of the Student instance is greater than or equal to 18 and outputs either "Eligible" or "Not Eligible" accordingly.

After defining the classes, two instances of the classes are created using the new keyword. The sayHello() and eligiblity() methods are called on these instances to log messages to the console.

In summary, the code demonstrates how to define a parent class and a child class that inherits from the parent class in JavaScript using the ES6 syntax. It also shows how to define and use properties and methods on the classes and their instances.

Conclusion
In summary, class and inheritance are important concepts in JavaScript that allow you to create reusable code and organize your program in a more efficient way. In this blog, we have shown you how to implement class and inheritance using both ES5 and ES6 syntax. Understanding these concepts and how to use them effectively can help you write better, more maintainable code in your JavaScript projects.

        <summary>Understanding Getters and Setters in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript is a versatile programming language that offers many powerful features for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. One of these features is the ability to define getters and setters for object properties. Getters and setters are functions that allow you to control the way that properties are accessed and modified, and they can be particularly useful in object-oriented programming.

getters and setters are special functions that allow you to control the way that object properties are accessed and modified. Getters are functions that are called when you try to access a property, and setters are functions that are called when you try to modify a property. They are often used in object-oriented programming to encapsulate and control the behavior of object properties.

The syntax for defining a getter or a setter is as follows:

const obj = {
  get propertyName() {
    // code to get the property value
  },
  set propertyName(value) {
    // code to set the property value
  }
};
The get keyword is used to define a getter, and the set keyword is used to define a setter. The name of the property being accessed or modified is used as the function name (in this example, propertyName). The getter function should return the value of the property, while the setter function should update the value of the property based on the argument passed to it.

Let's look at a couple of examples of how getters and setters work in JavaScript.

Example 1: Getters and Setters with Object Literals
In this example, we use an object literal to define a person object that has firstName and lastName properties. We then define a getter and a setter for a fullName property, which concatenates the first and last names together.

const person = {
firstName: 'Tutor',
lastName: 'Joes',
  get fullName() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  },
  set fullName(name) {
    const parts = name.split(' ');
this.firstName = parts[0];
this.lastName = parts[1];
  }
};

console.log(person.fullName); // output: "Tutor Joes"
person.fullName = "Sam Sundar";
console.log(person.firstName); // output: "Sam"
console.log(person.lastName); // output: "Sundar"
console.log(person.fullName); // output: "Sam Sundar"
In this example, the get fullName() function is called when we access the fullName property, and the set fullName() function is called when we set the fullName property. This allows us to encapsulate the behavior of the fullName property and ensure that it is always formatted correctly.

Example 2: Getters and Setters with Classes
In this example, we use a class definition to define a Circle class that has a radius property and two getters (diameter and area) and one setter (diameter).

class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
this.radius = radius;
  }

  get diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  }

  set diameter(diameter) {
this.radius = diameter / 2;
  }

  get area() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

const myCircle = new Circle(5);
console.log(myCircle.radius); // output: 5
console.log(myCircle.diameter); // output: 10
console.log(myCircle.area); // output: 78.53981633974483

myCircle.diameter = 12;
console.log(myCircle.radius); // output: 6
console.log(myCircle.diameter); // output: 12
console.log(myCircle.area); // output: 113.09733552923254
In this example, the diameter setter allows us to set the radius property based on a given diameter value, while the diameter getter and the area getter allow us to retrieve information about the circle. This allows us to abstract away the details of how the circle is represented and focus on its properties and behavior.

In conclusion, getters and setters are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow us to encapsulate and control the behavior of object properties. By using getters and setters, we can create more robust and maintainable code that is easier to work with and understand.

        <summary>Understanding Static Methods and Properties in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that supports a variety of programming paradigms. One of the key features of object-oriented programming is the ability to define classes, which are templates for creating objects with shared behaviors and properties.In JavaScript, classes can contain static methods and properties, which are class-level functions and variables that are not associated with instances of the class. In this blog post, we'll explore what static methods and properties are, how to define them, and when to use them.

Defining and Accessing Static Methods and Properties
Static methods and properties are defined using the static keyword before the method or property name. This tells JavaScript that the method or property should be associated with the class itself, rather than with instances of the class.

Here's an example of a class with a static method:

class MyClass {
  static myStaticMethod() {
console.log('Hello from a static method!');
  }
}

MyClass.myStaticMethod(); // Output: Hello from a static method!
In this example, we define a static method called myStaticMethod on the MyClass class. We can then call this method directly on the class, without creating an instance of the class first.

Here's an example of a class with a static property:

class MyClass {
  static myStaticProperty = 'Hello from a static property!';
}

console.log(MyClass.myStaticProperty); // Output: Hello from a static property!
In this example, we define a static property called myStaticProperty on the MyClass class. We can then access this property directly on the class, without creating an instance of the class first.

Use Cases for Static Methods and Properties
Static methods and properties are useful when you need to define functionality or data that is shared among all instances of a class, or when you need to perform a task that is not specific to any particular instance of a class.

For example, a utility class might contain a static method that performs a calculation or converts data between formats. A configuration class might contain a static property that stores global configuration settings.

Static methods and properties can also be used to enforce constraints or rules that apply to all instances of a class. For example, a class that represents a set of mathematical functions might have a static property that specifies the maximum or minimum input value for all functions in the set.

Here are some more examples of static methods and properties in JavaScript:

Example 1: Utility Class
You can use a static class to create a collection of utility functions that can be used throughout your application. For example, let's say you have a MathUtils class that provides various math-related functions:

class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  static subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }

  static multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }

  static divide(a, b) {
    return a / b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(MathUtils.multiply(4, 5)); // Output: 20
In this example, the MathUtils class provides four static methods for performing basic math operations. Because they are static methods, they can be called directly on the class without needing to create an instance of the class.

Example 2: Singleton Pattern
You can also use a static property to create a singleton pattern in JavaScript. The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a particular class can be created.

class Database {
  static instance = null;

  static getInstance() {
    if (!Database.instance) {
Database.instance = new Database();
    }
    return Database.instance;
  }

  query(sql) {
    // code to execute SQL query
  }
}

const db1 = Database.getInstance();
const db2 = Database.getInstance();

console.log(db1 === db2); // Output: true
In this example, the Database class has a static property called instance that is set to null by default. The getInstance() method checks if the instance property has been set and creates a new instance of the Database class if it hasn't. Once an instance has been created, the getInstance() method returns it. By doing this, we can ensure that only one instance of the Database class is created, even if we call getInstance() multiple times.

Example 3: Constants
Finally, you can use a static property to define a constant value that is associated with a class. For example:

class Colors {
  static RED = '#ff0000';
  static GREEN = '#00ff00';
  static BLUE = '#0000ff';
}

console.log(Colors.RED); // Output: #ff0000
console.log(Colors.GREEN); // Output: #00ff00
In this example, the Colors class defines three static properties that represent commonly used colors. By doing this, we can easily reference these colors throughout our code without needing to remember the hex values for each one.

Static methods and properties can be a powerful tool for creating flexible and reusable code in JavaScript. By associating functions and variables with a class rather than with instances of the class, you can create functionality that is more modular and easier to maintain.

Conclusion
Static methods and properties are a powerful feature of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. They allow you to define class-level functions and variables that are not associated with instances of the class, and to access them directly on the class itself. By using static methods and properties, you can create more flexible and maintainable code that is easier to work with and understand.

        <summary>Understanding Sets in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide</summary>
        <pre>
            Sets are a data structure in JavaScript that allow you to store unique values of any type. In this blog, we will cover everything you need to know about sets in JavaScript, including their syntax, methods, and practical use cases.

Here is a table showing all the inbuilt methods of sets in JavaScript:

Method	Description
add()	Adds a new value to the set.
clear()	Removes all values from the set.
delete()	Removes a specific value from the set.
entries()	Returns an iterator that contains the [value, value] pairs for each value in the set.
forEach()	Executes a provided function once for each value in the set, in insertion order.
has()	Returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the set or not.
keys()	Returns an iterator that contains the values for each value in the set.
size	Returns the number of values in the set.
values()	Returns an iterator that contains the values for each value in the set.
Creating Sets:
You can create a set in JavaScript by using the built-in Set constructor. Here is an example:

const mySet = new Set();
This creates an empty set. You can also pass an iterable object, such as an array, into the constructor to create a set with initial values:

const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
Adding and Removing Values:
You can add a value to a set using the add() method:

mySet.add(4);
You can remove a value from a set using the delete() method:

mySet.delete(3);
Checking Set Size:
You can check the size of a set using the size property:

console.log(mySet.size); // Output: 3
Checking for Values:
You can check if a value exists in a set using the has() method:

console.log(mySet.has(2)); // Output: true
console.log(mySet.has(5)); // Output: false
Iterating Over Sets:
You can iterate over a set using the forEach() method:

mySet.forEach(value => console.log(value));
Converting Sets to Arrays:
You can convert a set to an array using the spread operator:

const myArray = [...mySet];
entries()
Here's an example of how to use the entries() method to iterate over the [value, value] pairs for each value in a set:

const set = new Set(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']);
const iterator = set.entries();
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: ['apple', 'apple']
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: ['banana', 'banana']
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: ['cherry', 'cherry']
In this example, we create a set set with the values 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry'. We then use the entries() method to create an iterator that contains the [value, value] pairs for each value in the set.

We use the next() method on the iterator to iterate over each pair. The next() method returns an object with a value property that contains the next [value, value] pair in the iteration, as well as a done property that indicates whether the end of the iteration has been reached. Note that since sets only contain unique values, the entries() method returns pairs with the same value for both the key and the value. However, the entries() method is still useful for iterating over the values in a set in a consistent order.

keys()
Here's an example of how to use the keys() method to iterate over the values in a set:

const set = new Set(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']);
const iterator = set.keys();
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: 'apple'
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: 'banana'
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: 'cherry'
In this example, we create a set set with the values 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry'. We then use the keys() method to create an iterator that contains the keys (i.e., the values themselves) for each value in the set.

We use the next() method on the iterator to iterate over each key. The next() method returns an object with a value property that contains the next key in the iteration, as well as a done property that indicates whether the end of the iteration has been reached.Note that the keys() method is equivalent to the values() method, since sets only contain unique values. However, the keys() method is still useful for iterating over the values in a set in a consistent order.

In addition to these methods, there are also some static methods for sets:

Method	Description
Set()	Creates a new set.
from()	Creates a new set from an iterable object.
isSet()	Returns true if the provided value is a set; otherwise false.
of()	Creates a new set with a variable number of arguments.
These inbuilt methods and static methods make working with sets in JavaScript easier and more efficient.

from()
Here's an example of how to use the from() method to create a new set from an array:

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5];
const set = new Set.from(arr);
console.log(set); // Output: Set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
In this example, we create an array arr with some duplicate values. We then use the from() method to create a new set set from the array. The resulting set contains only the unique values from the original array, since sets can only contain unique values.

We can also use the from() method to create a new set from a string:

const str = 'hello';
const set = new Set.from(str);
console.log(set); // Output: Set {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'}
In this example, we create a string str and use the from() method to create a new set set from the string. The resulting set contains each character in the string as a separate value.Note that the from() method can also be used with other iterable objects, such as maps or arrays of arrays. This makes it a very versatile method for creating sets from existing data structures.

isSet()
Here's an example of how to use the isSet() method to check if a provided value is a set

const set = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
console.log(Set.isSet(set)); // Output: true
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(Set.isSet(arr)); // Output: false
In this example, we create a set set and use the isSet() method to check if it is a set. Since set is a set, the method returns true. We then create an array arr and use the isSet() method to check if it is a set. Since arr is not a set, the method returns false.

The isSet() method can be useful in situations where you need to check the type of a value before performing certain operations on it.

of()
Here's an example of how to use the of() method to create a new set with a variable number of arguments:

const set = new Set.of(1, 2, 3);
console.log(set); // Output: Set {1, 2, 3}
In this example, we use the of() method to create a new set set with the values 1, 2, and 3. The resulting set contains these values as separate values.

We can also use the of() method to create a set with a single value:

const set = new Set.of(1);
console.log(set); // Output: Set {1}
In this example, we create a new set set with the value 1. The resulting set contains this value as a single value. Note that the of() method is a static method, which means that it is called on the Set constructor rather than on an instance of the Set class. This allows us to create a new set without having to first create an empty set and then add values to it.

Tag Widget
Here is the real time example for unique tag widget for website or blog.

class TagsInput {
constructor() {
this.tags = new Set();
  }
addTag(newTag) {
this.tags.add(newTag);
    console.log(this.tags);
  }
}

const input = new TagsInput();
input.addTag("Ram");
input.addTag("Sam");
input.addTag("Ram");
input.addTag("Ravi");
Practical Use Cases:
Sets are useful in a variety of situations, such as:

Removing duplicates from an array

Checking if an array contains a specific value

Tracking unique user IDs in an application

Conclusion:
In this blog, we covered the basics of sets in JavaScript, including their syntax, methods, and practical use cases. By using sets, you can easily manage collections of unique values in your code.

        <summary>Exploring Map in JavaScript: Examples and Use Cases
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, a Map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and it can hold any type of values like objects, primitives, and other maps. In this code, we will learn about various methods and properties of the Map object in JavaScript.

The common functions associated with the Map object in JavaScript:

Method	Description
Map.prototype.clear()	Removes all key-value pairs from the map.
Map.prototype.delete(key)	Removes the entry with the specified key from the map.
Map.prototype.entries()	Returns an iterator object that contains an array of [key, value] pairs for each element.
Map.prototype.forEach(callbackFn)	Calls the specified function once for each key-value pair in the map.
Map.prototype.get(key)	Returns the value associated with the specified key in the map.
Map.prototype.has(key)	Returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified key is present in the map.
Map.prototype.keys()	Returns an iterator object that contains the keys for each element in the map.
Map.prototype.set(key, value)	Sets the value for the specified key in the map.
Map.prototype.values()	Returns an iterator object that contains the values for each element in the map.
Creating a Map Object:
To create a new Map object, we use the Map() constructor function. The code initializes an empty Map object and assigns it to the variable userMap:

const userMap = new Map();
Adding Elements to a Map:
To add a new key-value pair to the Map, we use the set() method. The following code adds four key-value pairs to the userMap:

userMap.set("name", "Joes"); 
userMap.set("age", 30); 
userMap.set("city", "Salem"); 
userMap.set("contact", "9043017689");
Printing a Map Object:
To print a Map object, we can simply log it to the console. The following code logs the userMap to the console:

console.log(userMap);
Updating the Value of a Map:
To update the value of an existing key in the Map, we can simply use the set() method again with the same key. The following code updates the age of the user in the userMap:

userMap.set("age", 31); 
console.log(userMap);
Map Size:
To get the size of a Map object, we can use the size property. The following code logs the size of the userMap:

console.log("Map Size: ", userMap.size);
Deleting a Key-Value Pair from a Map:
To remove a key-value pair from the Map, we can use the delete() method. The following code removes the city from the userMap:

console.log("Before Delete :", userMap);
userMap.delete("city"); 
console.log("After Delete :", userMap);
Retrieving a Value from a Map:
To retrieve the value of a key from the Map, we can use the get() method. The following code retrieves the value of the name key from the userMap:

console.log(userMap.get("name"));
Checking if a Key Exists in a Map:
To check if a key exists in the Map, we can use the has() method. The following code checks if the name and city keys exist in the userMap:

console.log(userMap.has("name")); 
console.log(userMap.has("city"));
Iterating a Map with for...of:
We can iterate over the keys and values of a Map using a for...of loop with destructuring. The following code logs each key-value pair of the userMap to the console:

for (const [key, value] of userMap) 
{ 
console.log(`${key} = ${value}`); 
}
Retrieving Keys from a Map:
We can retrieve all the keys of a Map using the keys() method. The following code logs each key of the userMap to the console:

for (const key of userMap.keys()) 
{ 
console.log(key); 
}
Retrieving Values from a Map:
We can retrieve all the values of a Map using thevalues() method. The following code logs each value of the userMap to the console:

for (const value of userMap.values()) 
{ 
   console.log(value); 
}
Retrieving Entries from a Map:
We can retrieve all the entries of a Map using theentries() method. The following code logs each entry of the userMap to the console:

for (const value of userMap.entries ()) 
{ 
   console.log(`${key}  = ${value}`); 
}
This code snippet uses the entries() method of a Map object to iterate over its key-value pairs and log them to the console. Here's how it works:

The entries() method returns an iterator object which iterates over the Map's key-value pairs. Each iteration returns an array with two elements: the key and the value of the current pair.
The for...of loop is used to iterate over the iterator and execute a block of code for each iteration. Inside the loop, we use array destructuring to assign the key and value of the current pair to the variables key and value, respectively.
Finally, we log the key-value pair to the console using string interpolation with a template literal.

Retrieving Key-value from a Map using forEach():
We can retrieve all the key-value of a Map using theforEach() method. The following code logs each key-value of the userMap to the console:

userMap.forEach((value, key) => {
  console.log(`${key}  = ${value}`);
});
This code snippet uses the forEach() method of a Map object to iterate over its key-value pairs and log them to the console. Here's how it works:

The forEach() method takes a callback function as its argument, which is executed for each key-value pair in the Map. The callback function receives two arguments: the value of the current pair, followed by its key.
Inside the callback function, we log the key-value pair to the console using string interpolation with a template literal.
Overall, this code snippet accomplishes the same thing as the previous one (iterating over a Map's key-value pairs and logging them to the console), but uses the forEach() method instead of a for...of loop with the entries() method. Both approaches are valid and have their own advantages depending on the situation.

Clear all values from a Map:
The clear() method is a built-in method of the Map object in JavaScript. It is used to remove all key-value pairs from a Map object. Here are some examples of how the clear() method can be used with Map:

userMap.clear();
console.log("After Clear :", userMap);
This code snippet calls the clear() method on a Map object, which removes all key-value pairs from the Map. Here's how it works:

The clear() method is a built-in method of a Map object that removes all key-value pairs from the Map. After calling this method, the Map will be empty.
After calling clear(), the code logs a message to the console with the contents of the Map. Since the Map has been cleared, the output will show an empty Map object.
Overall, this code snippet demonstrates how to use the clear() method to remove all key-value pairs from a Map object. It can be useful when you want to reset the Map to an empty state.

Relation with Array objects
In JavaScript, a Map object is a collection of key-value pairs that allows keys of any type, including objects, to be used as keys. A Map object can be created from an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains two elements, the key and the value. Here's an example:

const arr = [
  ["key1", "value1"],
  ["key2", "value2"],
];
const myMap = new Map(arr);
console.log(myMap);
console.log(myMap.get("key1"));
In the above code, an array of arrays arr is created, where each sub-array contains a key-value pair. A Map object myMap is created from the array arr. The console.log statements print the Map object and the value associated with the key "key1". To convert a Map object to an array, we can use the Array.from() method. Here's an example:

console.log(Array.from(myMap));
The Array.from() method creates a new array from an array-like object, which in this case is the Map object myMap. The resulting array will contain arrays with two elements, the key and the value.In summary, the above code shows how to create a Map object from an array of arrays and how to convert a Map object to an array using the Array.from() method. This can be useful when working with collections of key-value pairs in JavaScript.

The spread operator (...) can be used to spread the elements of an iterable object, such as an array or a Map object, into a new array or object. When used with a Map object, the spread operator creates an array of arrays containing the key-value pairs of the Map object.

Here's an example:

console.log([...myMap]);
In the above code, the spread operator is used to create a new array containing the key-value pairs of the Map object myMap.

To create an array of the keys or values of a Map object, we can use the Map.prototype.keys() or Map.prototype.values() methods, respectively. These methods return an iterable object that can be converted to an array using the Array.from() method.

Here are examples of how to create arrays of the keys and values of a Map object:

console.log(Array.from(myMap.keys()));
console.log(Array.from(myMap.values()));
In the above code, the Array.from() method is used to convert the iterable objects returned by myMap.keys() and myMap.values() to arrays.In summary, the spread operator can be used to create an array of arrays containing the key-value pairs of a Map object, while the Map.prototype.keys() and Map.prototype.values() methods can be used to create arrays of the keys or values of a Map object.

Using Maps in JavaScript: Common Mistakes and Best Practices
Maps are a useful data structure in JavaScript that allow you to store key-value pairs. They are similar to objects, but offer more flexibility and functionality. However, when working with Maps, it's important to be aware of some common mistakes that developers can make. In this blog post, we will discuss these mistakes and show you how to avoid them.

Mistake 1: Using the wrong syntax to set values

One common mistake is to use the wrong syntax to set values in a Map. This can happen when developers try to set values using the same syntax as they would use for an object. For example:

const wrongMap = new Map();
wrongMap["key1"] = "Data1";
wrongMap["key2"] = "Data2";
This is incorrect because Maps are not meant to be accessed like objects. Instead, you should use the set() method to add key-value pairs to a Map:

const correctMap = new Map();
correctMap.set("key1", "Data1");
correctMap.set("key2", "Data2");
Mistake 2: Not using the has() method to check if a key exists

Another mistake that developers make is to assume that a key exists in a Map without checking for it first. This can result in errors or unexpected behavior. To avoid this, you should always use the has() method to check if a key exists before trying to access its value:

const myMap = new Map();
myMap.set("key1", "value1");

if (myMap.has("key1")) {
  console.log(myMap.get("key1"));
}
Mistake 3: Treating keys as strings when they are not

Maps can use any type of value as a key, not just strings. However, if you try to use a non-string value as a key, it will be converted to a string. This can lead to unexpected results if you are not aware of it. To avoid this, you should always use the same type of value for a key that you intend to use when you retrieve it later:

const myMap = new Map();
const objKey = {};
const arrKey = [];

myMap.set(objKey, "value1");
myMap.set(arrKey, "value2");

console.log(myMap.get(objKey)); // "value1"
console.log(myMap.get({})); // undefined
console.log(myMap.get(arrKey)); // "value2"
console.log(myMap.get([])); // undefined
In this example, we use an object and an array as keys. If we try to retrieve the values using a different object or array, we will get undefined. This is because the keys are not the same object or array, even though they may have the same content.

Best Practices
To use Maps effectively in your code, follow these best practices:

Always use the set() method to add key-value pairs.
Use the has() method to check if a key exists before trying to access its value.
Use the same type of value for a key that you intend to use when you retrieve it later.
By following these best practices, you can avoid common mistakes and use Maps effectively in your code.

Using NaN as a Key in JavaScript Maps
In JavaScript, NaN stands for "Not a Number" and is a special value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value in a numeric context. One interesting feature of NaN is that it is not equal to any other value, including itself. This can make it a useful value to use as a key in Maps, but it also presents some challenges. In this blog post, we will explore how to use NaN as a key in Maps and some of the issues to be aware of.

Code Explanation
console.log(Number("Ram"));
const myMaps = new Map();
myMaps.set(NaN, "Not a Number");
console.log(myMaps.get(NaN));
The first line attempts to convert the string "Ram" into a number using the Number() function. Since "Ram" cannot be converted into a number, the result will be NaN.

Next, we create a new Map called myMaps and use the set() method to add a key-value pair to it. The key is NaN and the value is the string "Not a Number".

Finally, we use the get() method to retrieve the value associated with the key NaN from the map and log it to the console. The result will be "Not a Number".

Challenges of Using NaN as a Key
One of the main challenges of using NaN as a key in a Map is that NaN is not equal to any other value, including itself. This means that you cannot use the has() method to check if a key exists in a Map that is equal to NaN. Instead, you must use the isNaN() function to check for NaN explicitly:

const myMap = new Map();
myMap.set(NaN, "Not a Number");

console.log(myMap.has(NaN)); // false
console.log(isNaN([...myMap.keys()][0])); // true
In this example, we use the spread operator ... to convert the Map's keys into an array and then access the first key in the array. We then use the isNaN() function to check if this key is equal to NaN. The result will be true.

Another challenge of using NaN as a key is that it can cause unexpected behavior when used with certain operations, such as sorting:

const myMap = new Map();
myMap.set(NaN, "Not a Number");
myMap.set(1, "One");
myMap.set(2, "Two");

console.log([...myMap.entries()].sort()); // [[1, "One"], [2, "Two"], [NaN, "Not a Number"]]
In this example, we create a Map with three key-value pairs. When we use the spread operator and the sort() method to sort the entries, the NaN value will always be sorted to the end of the list. This is because NaN is not equal to any other value and cannot be compared using normal comparison operators.

Best Practices
To use NaN effectively as a key in your Map, follow these best practices:

Use isNaN() to check for NaN explicitly instead of using has().
Be aware of the potential for unexpected behavior when using NaN with certain operations, such as sorting.
By following these best practices, you can use NaN effectively as a key in your Maps without running into unexpected issues.

Merging Maps in JavaScript
In JavaScript, maps can be merged using the spread operator and an array. This allows you to combine the key-value pairs from multiple maps into a new map.

Here's an example of how to merge two maps using the spread operator:

//Maps can be merged with Arrays
const first = new Map([
  [1, "one"],
  [2, "two"],
  [3, "three"],
]);
const second = new Map([
  [1, "first"],
  [2, "second"],
]);
const merged = new Map([...first, ...second, [1, "Ist"]]);
console.log(merged);
console.log(merged.get(1));
console.log(merged.get(2));
console.log(merged.get(3));
This code demonstrates how two maps can be merged into a new map using the spread operator and an array.

In this example, we have two maps: first and second. first contains three key-value pairs, while second contains only two. We want to merge these maps into a new map called merged.

To do this, we create a new Map object and use the spread operator (...) to add the contents of both first and second maps to the new map. We also include an additional key-value pair [1, "Ist"] to overwrite the existing value for key 1 from first with the value "Ist". This means that the final value for key 1 in merged will be "Ist".

We then use the get() method to retrieve the values for each key in merged and log them to the console. The output will be:

Map(3) { 1 => 'Ist', 2 => 'second', 3 => 'three' }
Ist
second
three
Counting Word Frequency in JavaScript
we will explore how to count the frequency of words in a sentence using JavaScript.

Consider the following sentence:

Fear leads to anger anger leads to hatred hatred leads to conflict

Our goal is to count the frequency of each word in the sentence.

We can start by splitting the sentence into an array of words using the split() method. We pass a space " " as an argument to split the sentence into individual words:

const sentence = "Fear leads to anger anger leads to hatred hatred leads to conflict";
const words = sentence.split(" ");
console.log(words);
The output of console.log(words) will be an array of words:

[ 'Fear', 'leads', 'to', 'anger', 'anger', 'leads', 'to', 'hatred', 'hatred', 'leads', 'to', 'conflict' ]
Next, we create a Map() object to store the frequency of each word. We loop through each word in the words array and check if it already exists in the wordFrequency map using the has() method. If it exists, we increment the value of the corresponding key in the map using the get() and set() methods. If it does not exist, we set the value of the corresponding key to 1

const wordFrequency = new Map();
for (let word of words) {
  if (wordFrequency.has(word)) {
wordFrequency.set(word, wordFrequency.get(word) + 1);
  } else {
wordFrequency.set(word, 1);
  }
}
console.log(wordFrequency);
The output of console.log(wordFrequency) will be a Map() object containing the frequency of each word:

Map(6) {
  'Fear' => 1,
  'leads' => 3,
  'to' => 3,
  'anger' => 2,
  'hatred' => 2,
  'conflict' => 1
}
As we can see, the frequency of each word has been counted correctly. This technique can be useful for a variety of applications, such as analyzing text data or generating word clouds.

Grouping Objects by Property Value in JavaScript
we will explore how to group objects in an array by a specific property value using JavaScript.

Consider the following array of objects:

const people = [
{ name: "Raja", age: 30 },
{ name: "Sara", age: 25 },
{ name: "Suresh", age: 30 },
{ name: "Sundar", age: 25 },
];
Our goal is to group the objects in the array by age. In other words, we want to create a Map() object where each key is an age and the corresponding value is an array of objects with that age.

We can start by creating an empty Map() object to store the grouped objects:

const peopleByAge = new Map();
Next, we loop through each object in the people array and extract the age property. We check if the peopleByAge map already has a key with the same age using the has() method. If it exists, we get the value of the corresponding key using the get() method and push the current object into the array. If it does not exist, we create a new key-value pair where the key is the age and the value is an array containing the current object.

for (let person of people) {
  const age = person.age;
  if (peopleByAge.has(age)) {
peopleByAge.get(age).push(person);
  } else {
peopleByAge.set(age, [person]);
  }
}

Finally, we can log the peopleByAge map to see the result:

console.log(peopleByAge);
The output of console.log(peopleByAge) will be a Map() object containing the grouped objects:

Map(2) {
  30 => [    { name: 'Raja', age: 30 },    { name: 'Suresh', age: 30 }  ],
  25 => [    { name: 'Sara', age: 25 },    { name: 'Sundar', age: 25 }  ]
}
As we can see, the objects in the array have been grouped by age using the Map() object. This technique can be useful for a variety of applications, such as filtering or sorting data based on specific properties.

Counting the Frequency of Elements in an Array with JavaScript
In JavaScript, it is often useful to count the frequency of elements in an array. This can be achieved using a Map, which allows for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.

Here is an example function that counts the frequency of each element in an array:

function frequencyCounter(arr) {
  const map = new Map();
  <!-- for (let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++) { -->
    const element = arr[i];
map.set(element, (map.get(element) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return map;
}
The frequencyCounter function takes an array as input and returns a Map object with the frequency of each element. The function first initializes an empty Map object. It then iterates over the input array and sets each element as a key in the Map object. If the key already exists, the function increments the value of the key by 1. Otherwise, it sets the value of the key to 1.

Here are a couple of examples of using the frequencyCounter function:

const array = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4];
console.log(frequencyCounter(array));
// Output: Map(4) { 1 => 2, 2 => 3, 3 => 1, 4 => 1 }

const array2 = [1, 54, 1, 52];
console.log(frequencyCounter(array2));
// Output: Map(3) { 1 => 2, 54 => 1, 52 => 1 }
In the first example, the frequencyCounter function takes an array with 7 elements, and returns a Map object with 4 keys, each representing a unique element in the input array, and their corresponding values indicating the number of times the element appears in the input array.

In the second example, the frequencyCounter function takes an array with 4 elements, and returns a Map object with 3 keys, each representing a unique element in the input array, and their corresponding values indicating the number of times the element appears in the input array.

In summary, the frequencyCounter function is a useful utility function for counting the frequency of elements in an array using a Map object in JavaScript.

        <summary>JavaScript Destructuring Assignment</summary>
        <pre>
            JavaScript destructuring was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and is a feature of the language that makes it easier to extract data from arrays and objects.

Here's a brief overview of destructuring syntax in ES6:

Array Destructuring:
To destructure an array, you use square brackets [] on the left-hand side of the assignment operator =. Inside the square brackets, you define the variable names that correspond to the array elements you want to extract. You can also use the rest operator ... to capture the remaining elements of the array into a new array.

Here's an example:

Before ES6
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const first = numbers[0];
const second = numbers[1];
const rest = numbers.slice(2);
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(rest); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
After ES6
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = numbers;
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(rest); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
Object Destructuring:
To destructure an object, you use curly braces {} on the left-hand side of the assignment operator =. Inside the curly braces, you define the variable names that correspond to the object properties you want to extract.

Here's an example:

Before ES6
const person = { name: 'Joes', age: 30, gender: 'male' };
const  name = person.name;
const  age = person.age;
const gender = person.gender;
console.log(name); // Output: 'Joes'
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(gender); // Output: 'male'
After ES6
const person = { name: 'Joes', age: 30, gender: 'male' };
const { name, age, gender } = person;
console.log(name); // Output: 'Joes'
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(gender); // Output: 'male'
You can also use destructuring with nested objects and arrays, and you can combine array and object destructuring in the same statement.

Destructuring can make your code more concise and readable, especially when you're working with complex data structures. It's a powerful feature of ES6 that's widely used in modern JavaScript code.

JavaScript Destructuring with Default Values
You can also assign default values while using destructuring in JavaScript. To assign a default value, you can use the = operator in the destructuring syntax.

Here's an example of using default values with array destructuring

const numbers = [1, 2];
const [x, y, z = 3] = numbers;

console.log(x); // Output: 1
console.log(y); // Output: 2
console.log(z); // Output: 3 (default value)
In this example, we define an array numbers with two elements (1 and 2). We then use array destructuring to assign the first element of the array to the variable x, the second element to the variable y, and a default value of 3 to the variable z.Since the numbers array has only two elements, the variable z is assigned its default value of 3.

Here's an example of using default values with object destructuring:

const person = { name: 'Joes', age: 30 };
const { name, age, gender = 'male' } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: 'Joes'
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(gender); // Output: 'male' (default value)
In this example, we define an object person with two properties (name and age). We then use object destructuring to assign the value of the name property to the variable name, the value of the age property to the variable age, and a default value of 'male' to the variable gender.

Since the person object does not have a gender property, the variable gender is assigned its default value of 'male'.Default values in destructuring allow you to handle cases where a property or element may be undefined or null. They provide a convenient way to assign fallback values that ensure your code runs correctly and reliably.

Swapping Variables with Ease: Using Destructuring Assignment Syntax in JavaScript
Swapping using destructuring assignment is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. The basic idea is to use destructuring assignment to assign the values of two variables to an array, and then immediately destructure the array back into the variables in reverse order.

For example, if you have two variables a and b and you want to swap their values, you can use destructuring assignment like this:

let a = 1;
let b = 2;

[a, b] = [b, a];

console.log(a); // Output: 2
console.log(b); // Output: 1
In this example, we use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b. We create a new array [b, a] and immediately destructure it back into the variables a and b in reverse order. After the destructuring assignment, a is assigned the value of b (2) and b is assigned the value of a (1).

Swapping using destructuring assignment is a concise and elegant way to exchange the values of two variables and is widely used in modern JavaScript development.

Efficient Array Manipulation in JavaScript: Skipping Unwanted Items with Destructuring Assignment
In JavaScript, you can skip unwanted items in an array without assigning them to local variables by using commas to indicate the position of the items you want to skip.

For example, if you have an array myArray with five elements and you only want to extract the first and fourth elements into local variables, you can use commas to indicate the positions of the second, third, and fifth elements that you want to skip:

let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let [first,, , fourth,] = myArray;
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(fourth); // Output: 4
In this example, we use destructuring assignment to extract the first and fourth elements of myArray into local variables first and fourth, respectively. We use commas to indicate the positions of the second, third, and fifth elements that we want to skip. Note that the commas must be included in the destructuring pattern to indicate the positions of the items you want to skip. This allows you to extract only the values you need from an array without having to assign all the elements to local variables.

Efficient Data Manipulation in JavaScript: Assigning Remaining Elements to a Single Variable using Destructuring and Rest Syntax for Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, you can use destructuring and rest syntax to efficiently manipulate data in arrays and objects. The rest syntax allows you to extract the remaining elements or properties of an array or object into a new array or object, which you can then assign to a single variable. This makes it easier to work with arrays and objects of varying length and structure in JavaScript.

Here's an example of how to use destructuring andrest syntax with arrays:

let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

let [first, second, ...rest] = myArray;

console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(rest); // Output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
In this example, we use destructuring assignment to extract the first two elements of myArray into local variables first and second, respectively, and the rest of the elements into a new array rest.

And here's an example of how to use destructuring and rest syntax with objects:

let myObj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5, f: 6, g: 7};

let {a, b, ...rest} = myObj;

console.log(a); // Output: 1
console.log(b); // Output: 2
console.log(rest); // Output: {c: 3, d: 4, e: 5, f: 6, g: 7}
In this example, we use destructuring assignment to extract the first two elements of myObj into local variables a and b, respectively, and the rest of the elements into a new object rest.

Nested Destructuring Assignment in JavaScript
Nested destructuring assignment is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from nested objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a concise way. It's a powerful technique that can make your code more readable and maintainable

Let's take a look at some examples to understand how nested destructuring assignment works:

Destructuring an object with nested objects:

const user = {
  name: 'Tutor Joes',
  address: {
    city: 'Salem',
    state: 'Tamil Nadu',
    country: 'India'
  }
};

const { name, address: { city, state } } = user;

console.log(name); // 'Tutor Joes'
console.log(city); // 'Salem'
console.log(state); // 'Tamil Nadu'
In this example, we have an object user with a nested object address. We use destructuring assignment to extract the values of name, city, and state from the user object. Note that we use the syntax address: { city, state } to destructure the nested object.

Destructuring an array with nested arrays:

const numbers = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
const [a, b, [c, d, [e, f]]] = numbers;
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
console.log(c); // 3
console.log(d); // 4
console.log(e); // 5
console.log(f); // 6
In this example, we have an array numbers with nested arrays. We use destructuring assignment to extract the values of a, b, c, d, e, and f from the numbers array. Note that we use the syntax [c, d, [e, f]] to destructure the nested array.

Destructuring an array of objects with nested objects:

const users = [
  {
    name: 'Tutor Joes',
    address: {
      city: 'Salem',
      state: 'Tamil Nadu',
      country: 'India'
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Sara',
    address: {
      city: 'Chennai',
      state: 'Tamil Nadu',
      country: 'India'
    }
  }
];
const [{ name: name1, address: { city: city1 } }, { name: name2, address: { city: city2 } }] = users;
console.log(name1); // 'Tutor Joes'
console.log(city1); // 'Salem'
console.log(name2); // 'Sara'
console.log(city2); // 'Chennai'
In this example, we have an array user of objects with nested objects. We use destructuring assignment to extract the values of name1, city1, name2, and city2 from the users array. Note that we use the syntax { name: name1, address: { city: city1 } } to destructure the nested objects. Overall, nested destructuring assignment is a powerful feature that can make your code more concise and readable when working with nested data structures in JavaScript.

        <summary>The Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript: An Introduction</summary>
        <pre>
            DOM (Document Object Model)
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure called the DOM tree. Each node in the tree represents an element, attribute, or piece of text in the document.

In JavaScript, the DOM can be accessed and manipulated using the DOM API, which allows developers to dynamically update and modify the content and style of web pages. Using JavaScript, you can manipulate DOM elements by changing their properties, adding or removing classes, and updating their content.

DOM manipulation is a core aspect of client-side web development, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages that respond to user actions. With the DOM, you can add event listeners to elements and respond to user events such as clicks, hovers, and key presses.

To manipulate the DOM in JavaScript, you first need to select the elements you want to work with using methods such as document.getElementById, document.getElementsByClassName, and document.querySelector. Once you have a reference to an element, you can manipulate its properties and attributes using standard JavaScript syntax.

Overall, the DOM is an essential part of web development, enabling developers to create powerful, interactive, and responsive web applications.

What is DOM ?
The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language but is instead a Web API used to build websites
The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language.
The browser creates the DOM to render the page.
The Browser gives JavaScript access to the DOM which is a programming language.
The DOM is not a part of JavaScript Engine.
Brower gives the DOM API Function likes getElemtentById(),createElement() etc. and these functions are not from JavaScript but these all are provided by DOM API
In order to speak with DOM the browser gives us access by DOM API Application Programming Interface.
JavaScript is programming language that browsers can execute.
We can divide the browser into two components
DOM
JavaScript Engine (Chrome V8 Engine)
DOM API is the bridge between the DOM and JavaScript Engine
The JavaScript engine is also present in the browser independently.
What we can do with DOM
Change css styles applied to elements.
Remove HTML Elements
We can add Event Listeners to HTML elements like (click, keyup, etc..)
Change attribute values dynamically (e.g href, src, alt)
Create new dynamic HTML element.
DOM API
Environments
A JavaScript environment is a collection of tools, libraries, and resources that allow developers to write and execute JavaScript code. It includes everything that is needed to run JavaScript, such as the JavaScript engine, libraries, and a set of APIs for interacting with the browser or server environment.There are several JavaScript environments, including the

Browser environment
Node.js environment
Mobile environment.
Js environment
Browser environment

The browser environment is the most commonly used JavaScript environment, which runs JavaScript code directly in the browser. The browser provides a JavaScript engine (such as V8 for Chrome), the DOM API for manipulating the HTML and CSS of a web page, and other APIs for interacting with the browser, such as the window and document objects.

Node.js environment

Node.js is another popular JavaScript environment, which allows JavaScript to run on the server-side. It provides a set of APIs for accessing the file system, network, and other resources that are not available in the browser environment. Node.js also includes a package manager (npm) that allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries and frameworks.

Mobile environment

The mobile environment includes mobile web browsers and hybrid mobile apps, which run JavaScript code in a native environment. It provides a set of APIs for accessing device features, such as the camera, accelerometer, and GPS.

Overall, the JavaScript environment is essential for developers to create web and mobile applications using JavaScript. Understanding the different environments and their APIs is crucial for developing efficient and reliable JavaScript applications.

Here is an Example for DOM in javascript

let brand = document.getElementById("brand");
console.log(brand);
console.log(brand.nodeType);
console.log(brand.nodeName);
brand.style.backgroundColor = "purple";
brand.style.color = "white";

let stitle = document.getElementsByClassName("sub-title");

console.log(stitle);

stitle[0].style.color = "Red";
stitle[1].style.color = "Red";
/*
stitle.forEach((element) => {

for (let i = 0; i < stitle.length; i++) {
  stitle[i].style.color = "blue";
}

let para = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
console.log(para);

for (let i = 0; i < para.length; i++) {

heading.style.color = "orange";

let qpara = document.querySelectorAll("p");
console.log(qpara);
qpara.forEach((element) => {
  element.style.color = "blue";
});
This code is an example of using the Document Object Model (DOM) API in JavaScript to manipulate the style of HTML elements on a web page.

The first line selects an HTML element with the ID "brand" using the getElementById method and assigns it to a variable called brand. The code then logs the brand variable to the console and retrieves information about the node type and name of the element using the nodeType and nodeName properties.

The next few lines change the background color and text color of the brand element using the style property.

The code then selects all elements with the class "sub-title" using the getElementsByClassName method and assigns them to a variable called stitle. The stitle variable is logged to the console, and the text color of each element is changed to either red or blue using a for loop.

The code then selects all p elements using the getElementsByTagName method and assigns them to a variable called para. The para variable is logged to the console, and the text color of each element is changed to purple using a for loop.

The code then selects the first h1 element using the querySelector method and assigns it to a variable called heading. The heading variable is logged to the console, and the text color of the element is changed to orange using the style property.

Finally, the code selects all p elements using the querySelectorAll method and assigns them to a variable called qpara. The qpara variable is logged to the console, and the text color of each element is changed to blue using a forEach loop.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to select and manipulate HTML elements using the DOM API in JavaScript.

        <summary>Understanding Family Structure in the DOM API in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
            In the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript, family structure refers to the hierarchical relationship between HTML elements on a web page. The DOM tree represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like structure, where each node in the tree represents an element, attribute, or piece of text in the document. The family structure of DOM is also known as the parent-child relationship.

Every element in the DOM tree has a parent element, except for the root element which is the topmost element in the tree. The parent element is the element that contains other child elements within it. The child elements, on the other hand, are the elements that are contained within a parent element.

The family structure of DOM allows developers to traverse and manipulate the structure of HTML elements on a web page. Developers can access and manipulate elements by selecting them based on their position in the DOM tree using methods such as getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector.

Furthermore, developers can also manipulate the family structure of DOM by adding, removing, or moving elements within the tree using methods such as appendChild, insertBefore, and removeChild.

Overall, the family structure of DOM is an essential concept for web development and provides a powerful tool for developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Understanding the parent-child relationship between HTML elements is crucial for manipulating the structure of a web page using the DOM API in JavaScript.

        <summary>Building a Family Tree with JavaScript DOM Manipulation</summary>
        <pre>
            A DOM family tree in JavaScript is a visualization of a family hierarchy using the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques. It involves creating a tree structure where each node represents a family member, and the edges represent the relationships between them. The family tree can be used to display information such as names, ages, and other relevant details about each family member.

Creating a family tree using the DOM requires creating a hierarchical structure using HTML elements such as <ul> and <li>. JavaScript is then used to add and remove nodes, and manipulate the DOM to update the tree structure. CSS is used to style the tree, such as adding colors and borders to nodes and edges.

One way to build a family tree is to start with the root node, which represents the first family member, and then add child nodes to represent each of their children. Each child node can then have child nodes of their own to represent their children, and so on. This creates a hierarchical structure where each node has one parent and zero or more children.

Overall, a DOM family tree can be a useful tool for visualizing family relationships and genealogy, and JavaScript DOM manipulation provides a powerful and flexible way to create and manipulate these structures.

For Example

<!-- <html>
  <body>
    <section>
      <h1>This is Heading</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Sample Title</h2>
        <p>This is  para1</p>
        <p>This is  para2</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Sample Title</h2>
        <p>This is  para3</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  </body>
</html> -->
family Tree

The given code is an HTML document that contains a DOM tree consisting of several nested elements. The tree starts with the html element, which contains a body element. Inside the body element, there is a section element that contains two div elements.

The first div element contains an h2 element, and two p elements. The second div element contains an h2 element and a p element. The h2 and p elements are child elements of their respective div elements.

The h1 element is a child of the section element, which makes it a sibling of the two div elements. Similarly, the section element is a child of the body element, which makes it a sibling of any other elements in the body.

Overall, the structure of the DOM tree can be represented as follows the image.

        <summary>DOM Traversing in JavaScript: Navigating the Document Object Model</summary>
        <pre>
            DOM traversing in JavaScript refers to the process of navigating the Document Object Model (DOM) to access and manipulate elements and their properties within an HTML document. The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the structure of an HTML document, where each element is represented by a node in the tree.

There are several methods in JavaScript that allow for DOM traversing, including:

parentNode and childNodes: These properties allow you to access the parent and child nodes of an element, respectively.
nextSibling and previousSibling: These properties allow you to access the next and previous sibling nodes of an element.
firstChild and lastChild: These properties allow you to access the first and last child nodes of an element.
querySelector and querySelectorAll: These methods allow you to search for elements within the DOM using CSS-style selectors.
getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName: These methods allow you to access elements in the DOM based on their ID, class name, or tag name, respectively.
Using these methods and properties, you can traverse the DOM to locate specific elements and manipulate their properties, such as changing their text content or modifying their style. DOM traversing is a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages in JavaScript.

parentNode
In JavaScript, a parent node refers to the node that is immediately higher in the DOM (Document Object Model) hierarchy relative to another node.

In other words, if a particular node has child nodes, then its parent node is the immediate node that contains it. For example, consider the following HTML code:

<div>
   <h2>Sample Title</h2>
   <p>This is Paragraph</p>
</div>
In this code, the parent node is the div element, which contains two child nodes, both of which are h2 and p elements.

In JavaScript, you can access the parent node of an element using the parentNode property. For example, to access the parent node of the second child p element in the example above, you could use the following code:

const para = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
console.log(para);
const parent = para[0].parentNode;
console.log(parent);
parent.style.backgroundColor = "palegreen";
parent.style.padding = "10px";

const h1 = document.getElementsByTagName("h1");
console.log(h1);
const parent_h1 = h1[0].parentNode;
parent_h1.style.backgroundColor = "palevioletred";
parent_h1.style.padding = "10px";

      </div>
    </section>

</html> -->
parent node

First and Last Child
In JavaScript, the terms "first child" and "last child" typically refer to the first and last elements of a parent element's child node list.

To understand this concept, it's helpful to first understand the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for web documents. The DOM represents the page as a tree-like structure, where each element is a node in the tree.

child method
In the context of the DOM, a "parent element" is an element that contains one or more child elements. For example, if you have an HTML document with a <div> element containing several other elements, the <div> element would be the parent element, and the other elements would be its child elements.

Using JavaScript, you can access the child nodes of a parent element using the childNodes property. This property returns an array-like object called a NodeList, which contains all of the child nodes of the parent element, including any text nodes or comments.

To get the first child element of a parent element, you can use the firstElementChild property. This property returns the first child element of the parent element, or null if the parent element has no child elements.

Similarly, to get the last child element of a parent element, you can use the lastElementChild property. This property returns the last child element of the parent element, or null if the parent element has no child elements.



Here's an example that demonstrates how to get the first and last child elements of a parent element:
<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>

      </div>
    </section>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html> -->
script.js
//firstChild
const firstChild = parent.firstChild;
console.log(firstChild);
//lastChild
const lastChild = parent.lastChild;
console.log(lastChild);

//firstElementChild
const firstElementChild = parent.firstElementChild;
console.log(firstElementChild);
firstElementChild.style.color = "blue";
//lastElementChild
const lastElementChild = parent.lastElementChild;
console.log(lastElementChild);
lastElementChild.style.color = "red";

const section = document.getElementsByTagName("section")[0];
console.log(section.firstChild);
console.log(section.firstElementChild);
console.log(section.lastChild);
console.log(section.lastElementChild);

console.log(h1[0].firstChild);
console.log(h1[0].firstElementChild);
console.log(h1[0].lastChild);
console.log(h1[0].lastElementChild);
//children
const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0];
console.log(div);
console.log(div.children[0]);
console.log(div.children[1]);
console.log(div.childElementCount);
console.log(div.childNodes);
Siblings
In JavaScript, the DOM (Document Object Model) represents the HTML elements of a web page as a tree-like structure. DOM siblings refer to the HTML elements that share the same parent element in the DOM tree.

For example, consider the following HTML code:

<div>
   <h2>Sample Title</h2>
   <p>This is Paragraph</p>
</div>
In this code, the parent node is the div element, which contains two child nodes, both of which are h2 and p elements.In other words, they are all direct children of the div element.

We can use JavaScript to access these sibling elements using various DOM methods. For example, we can use the parentNode property to get the parent element of any of the child elements:

We can also use the previousSibling and nextSibling properties to get the siblings of an element. For example, we can use nextSibling to get the next sibling of the first element

It's important to note that the previousSibling and nextSibling properties return all types of nodes, not just HTML elements. This means that we may need to use additional logic to filter out non-element nodes.

In summary, DOM siblings in JavaScript refer to the HTML elements that share the same parent element in the DOM tree. We can use various DOM methods to access and manipulate these sibling elements.

const p = document.getElementsByTagName("p")[0];
console.log(p);
console.log(p.previousSibling);
console.log(p.previousElementSibling);

const h2 = document.getElementsByTagName("h2")[0];
console.log(h2);
console.log(h2.nextSibling);
console.log(h2.nextElementSibling);

const section = document.getElementsByTagName("section")[0];
console.log(section);
console.log(section.nextSibling);
console.log(section.nextElementSibling);
console.log(section.previousSibling);
console.log(section.previousElementSibling);
Closest
In JavaScript, the closest() method is a DOM method that allows you to traverse up the DOM tree from a specific element and find the closest ancestor element that matches a specified CSS selector. This method can be particularly useful when you need to find a specific parent element that contains a certain child element.

Here is the syntax for using the closest() method:

element.closest(selector);
Here, element is the element you want to start the search from, and selector is a CSS selector that specifies the type of element you are looking for. The closest() method returns the closest ancestor element of element that matches the selector, or null if no matching element is found.

For example, consider the following HTML code:

<div>
   <h2>Sample Title</h2>
   <p>This is Paragraph</p>
</div>
If you want to find the closest ancestor element of the <p> element that has the class "parent", you can use the closest() method like this:

const h1_tag = document.querySelector("h1");
console.log(h1_tag);
const section = h1_tag.closest("section");
console.log(section);
section.style.background = "purple";
section.style.color = "white";
section.style.padding = "10px";
This JavaScript code first selects the first <h1> element in the HTML document using the querySelector() method and assigns it to the h1_tag variable.Then, it uses the closest() method to find the closest ancestor element of the h1_tag that is a <section> element and assigns it to the section variable.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the closest() method to find an ancestor element based on its tag name and how to use the style property to modify the CSS styles of an element in JavaScript.

        <summary>Creating HTML Elements with the DOM Create Method in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
            In JavaScript, you can create, manipulate, and modify HTML elements on a webpage using the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the webpage as a tree-like structure of objects, where each node represents an element in the HTML document.

In JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM) allows developers to dynamically create HTML elements and insert them into the web page. There are several methods that can be used to create new elements in the DOM, including createElement, createTextNode, and appendChild.

createElement(tagName) : This method creates a new element with the specified tag name, such as "div", "p", "img", etc.
createTextNode(text): This method creates a new text node with the specified text.
appendChild(node) : This method adds a node as the last child of a specified parent node.
insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode) : This method inserts a new node before an existing node in the DOM.
removeChild : This method that is used to remove a child element from its parent element.
remove : This is a newer method that allows you to remove an element directly, without specifying its parent.
These methods allow you to create and manipulate elements in the DOM dynamically using JavaScript. This can be useful for creating dynamic user interfaces, animating elements, and more.

createElement
In JavaScript, createElement() is a method used to create a new element node in the Document Object Model (DOM). It allows you to dynamically generate HTML elements on the fly, which can be very useful when building dynamic web applications.

The createElement() method is available on the document object, which represents the current web page. To use it, you need to call the createElement() method and pass in the name of the element you want to create as a string. For example, to create a new div element, you would call

Once you have created the new element, you can manipulate it in various ways using JavaScript. For example, you can set its attributes, add it to the DOM, or modify its content. Here's an example

let para = document.createElement("p");
para.innerHTML = "This is a <i>Sample Paragraph</i>";
para.style.color = "brown";
This code creates a new p element in the current HTML document using the createElement method of the document object in JavaScript.

The newly created element is then assigned to the variable para.

Next, the innerHTML property of the para element is set to the string "This is a <i>Sample Paragraph</i>>". This will create a new paragraph with the text "This is a" and an italicized "Sample Paragraph" within it.

Finally, the style.color property of the para element is set to "brown", which will change the color of the text in the paragraph to brown.

appendChild
In JavaScript, appendChild() is a method that adds a new child node to the end of a parent node.

The appendChild() method can also be used to move an existing element to a new location within the DOM. Simply call appendChild() on the new parent element and pass in the existing element as the parameter. This will remove the existing element from its current location and place it at the end of the new parent element.

Here is an example:

const body = document.querySelector("body");
body.appendChild(para);
The code const body = document.querySelector("body"); selects the element from the HTML document using the querySelector method and assigns it to the body variable.

The code body.appendChild(para); appends the para element (which was created earlier with document.createElement("p")) to the end of the body element. This is achieved using the appendChild method which is used to add a child element to the end of the parent element. In this case, the parent element is the body element and the child element being added is the para element.

So, the overall effect of these two lines of code is to create a new paragraph element, set its innerHTML to "This is a Sample Paragraph" (with the word "Sample" in italics), set its color to brown, and then append it as a child element to the end of the element in the HTML document.

insertBefore
The insertBefore method in JavaScript is used to insert a new HTML element before an existing element on the webpage. It is a method of the parent node and allows you to add an element to the existing DOM tree as a child element.

The syntax for insertBefore method is as follows:

parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode);
Here, parentNode is the node before which you want to insert the new node, newNode is the node that you want to insert, and referenceNode is the node that you want to insert the new node before.

Here is an example:

let h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.innerHTML = "This is Heading";
h1.style.color = "red";
body.insertBefore(h1, para);
This code creates a new h1 element using the createElement method and sets its innerHTML to "This is Heading". The color of the text in the h1 element is set to red using the style.color property.

Then, it uses the insertBefore method to insert the h1 element before the para element in the body. This means that the h1 element will be placed just before the para element in the HTML structure of the body.

The syntax for the insertBefore method is parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode), where parentNode is the element that the new node will be inserted into, newNode is the new element being inserted, and referenceNode is the existing element before which the new node will be inserted.

removeChild
In JavaScript, the removeChild() method is used to remove a specified child node from its parent node. It is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of an HTML page.

The syntax of the removeChild() method is as follows:

parent.parent(child);
where parent is the node from which we want to remove the child node and child is the node to be removed.

Here is an example:

const removeBtns = document.querySelectorAll(".btnRemove");
removeBtns.forEach((btn) => {
  btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
    const tr = this.parentNode.parentNode;
    let td = tr.childNodes[5];
    console.log(td);
    tr.removeChild(td)
  });
});
This JavaScript code selects all elements with a class of "btnRemove" using the querySelectorAll() method and stores them in the removeBtns variable as a NodeList. It then iterates through each button using the forEach() method and adds a click event listener to each button.

When the button is clicked, the function defined in the event listener is executed. It selects the parent node of the button twice to get the tr element that contains the button. It then selects the sixth child node of the tr element (which is the sixth td element), and removes it from the tr element using the removeChild() method.

Essentially, this code removes the sixth column of a table row when the corresponding "Remove" button is clicked.

remove
In JavaScript, the remove() method is used to remove an element from the DOM. This method is available on any DOM element and can be called directly on the element itself.

The remove() method does not take any arguments, and simply removes the element from the DOM, along with all its child nodes and event listeners. Once an element is removed from the DOM, it is no longer visible on the web page.

Here is an example:

const removeBtns = document.querySelectorAll(".btnRemove");
removeBtns.forEach((btn) => {
  btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
    const tr = this.parentNode.parentNode;
    //tr.remove();
  });
});
This code defines a click event listener on all the elements with class name "btnRemove" using the querySelectorAll() method. It then iterates over each element using the forEach() method and adds a click event listener to each of them.

When a user clicks on a button with class "btnRemove", it triggers the event listener function, which selects the parent node of the button twice to get to the table row (tr) containing the button using parentNode property.

The code is currently commented out, but if the tr.remove() line was not commented out, it would remove the entire table row from the HTML document using the remove() method.

This code is useful for creating a delete function for a table row in an HTML document.

        <summary>Exploring the Powerful Output Possibilities of DOM Manipulation in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
          In JavaScript, the DOM (Document Object Model) provides a way to interact with the HTML and XML documents on a web page. The output possibilities for DOM manipulation in JavaScript are many and varied, but some common examples include:

Changing HTML content: You can use JavaScript to change the HTML content of an element on a web page. For example, you can change the text of a paragraph, the source of an image, or the href attribute of a link.
Modifying CSS styles: You can also use JavaScript to modify the CSS styles of elements on a web page. For example, you can change the background color, font size, or position of an element.
Manipulating the DOM structure: JavaScript can also be used to add, remove, or modify elements in the DOM tree. For example, you can create new elements, delete existing ones, or move elements from one location to another.
Responding to user input: JavaScript can be used to respond to user input, such as mouse clicks or keyboard events. For example, you can create a button that triggers an event when clicked, or you can listen for keyboard events to respond to user input.
Creating animations: JavaScript can be used to create animations on a web page, such as fading in or out an element, or moving an element across the screen.
style
In JavaScript, "style" typically refers to the CSS styling of HTML elements that are manipulated using JavaScript.

JavaScript allows you to modify the style of HTML elements by accessing their style properties. These properties include various CSS styles such as background color, font size, margin, padding, border, and many others. You can use the style property of an element to change its appearance.

For example, if you have an HTML element like this:

 <h1>Tutor Joes</h1>
JavaScript code

const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
h1.style.color = "blue";
h1.style.backgroundColor = "palegreen";
h1.style.padding = "20px";
This JavaScript code retrieves the first h1 element in the HTML document using the querySelector() method and stores it in the h1 constant.The code then uses the style property of the h1 element to modify its CSS styles dynamically.

Specifically, the first line of the code sets the color of the text inside the h1 element to "blue" by accessing the color style property of the h1 element and setting it to "blue".The second line sets the background color of the h1 element to "palegreen" by accessing the backgroundColor style property of the h1 element and setting it to "palegreen".

Finally, the third line sets the padding of the h1 element to "20px" by accessing the padding style property of the h1 element and setting it to "20px".Overall, this code dynamically modifies the CSS styles of the h1 element, making it have blue text on a pale green background with a 20-pixel padding.

innerHTML
In JavaScript, innerHTML is a property of the HTMLElement interface that allows you to get or set the HTML content inside an element.When you get the value of innerHTML, it returns a string containing the HTML content inside the element, including any nested elements and their content.

For example, if you have an HTML element like this:

 <h1>Tutor Joes</h1>
JavaScript code

const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
h1.innerHTML = "Learn More <i>Be Smart</i>";
This JavaScript code retrieves the first h1 element in the HTML document using the querySelector() method and stores it in the h1 constant.The code then uses the innerHTML property of the h1 element to modify its HTML content dynamically.

Specifically, the code sets the innerHTML property of the h1 element to a new string that contains the text "Learn More" followed by an italicized "Be Smart" text.The <i> tag in the string is an HTML tag that stands for italic and is used to format text in italics.

Therefore, after executing this code, the content of the h1 element would change to "Learn More Be Smart" with "Be Smart" displayed in italics.Overall, this code uses the innerHTML property of the h1 element to modify its HTML content dynamically, making it display the new text with a stylized italic format.

innerText
In JavaScript, innerText is a property of the HTMLElement interface that allows you to get or set the text content inside an element, excluding any HTML tags.When you get the value of innerText, it returns a string containing the text content inside the element, without any HTML tags.

For example, if you have an HTML element like this:

 <h1>Tutor Joes</h1>
JavaScript code

const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
h1.innerText = "Learn More <i>Be Smart</i>";
This JavaScript code retrieves the first h1 element in the HTML document using the querySelector() method and stores it in the h1 constant.The code then uses the innerText property of the h1 element to modify its text content dynamically.

Specifically, the code sets the innerText property of the h1 element to a new string that contains the text "Learn More <i>Be Smart</i>".Note that unlike innerHTML, using innerText would not create an italicized text for the "Be Smart" text because it does not parse and display HTML tags. Instead, the entire string, including the <i> tag, will be treated as plain text and displayed as such.

Therefore, after executing this code, the content of the h1 element would change to "Learn More <i>Be Smart</i>", with the <i> tag visible as plain text instead of displaying an italicized "Be Smart" text. Overall, this code uses the innerText property of the h1 element to modify its text content dynamically, making it display the new string of text with the <i> tag treated as plain text.

cloneNode()
In JavaScript, cloneNode() is a method that creates a copy of an HTML element and all its child nodes. The new copy is called a "clone" and is a separate object from the original element, with its own set of properties and attributes.

Here's an example of how to use cloneNode():

 <h1>Tutor Joes</h1>
JavaScript code

const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
const body = document.querySelector("body");
let cloneH1 = h1.cloneNode(true);
let cloneH2 = h1.cloneNode(false);
body.appendChild(cloneH1);
body.appendChild(cloneH2);
This JavaScript code selects the first h1 element and the body element from the HTML document using the querySelector() method and stores them in the h1 and body constants, respectively. The code then creates two new variables, cloneH1 and cloneH2, and assigns them the result of calling cloneNode() method on the h1 element.

The first cloneH1 variable is created by calling cloneNode() with the argument true. This creates a deep clone of the h1 element, which means that all of its child nodes, including any nested elements, are also cloned.
The second cloneH2 variable is created by calling cloneNode() with the argument false. This creates a shallow clone of the h1 element, which means that only the element itself is cloned, and not its child nodes.
The code then appends both cloneH1 and cloneH2 to the body element using the appendChild() method.
In this example, after executing the code, the body element would contain two new elements: cloneH1 and cloneH2.
cloneH1 would be a deep clone of the original h1 element, including all of its child nodes. Therefore, cloneH1 would be a duplicate of the original h1 element, with the same text content, attributes, and child nodes.
cloneH2, on the other hand, would only be a shallow clone of the original h1 element, without any child nodes. Therefore, cloneH2 would be a new h1 element with the same attributes and properties as the original h1 element, but without any of its child nodes.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to use cloneNode() to create deep and shallow copies of an HTML element, which can be useful when you need to duplicate an element and manipulate its content or style without affecting the original source.
Using cloneNode() can be a useful way to create a copy of an HTML element and its child nodes, which can be manipulated and modified independently of the original element. This can be particularly useful in cases where you want to create dynamic content or modify existing elements without affecting the original source.

setInterval()
In JavaScript, setInterval is a method that repeatedly calls a function or executes a code block at a specified interval of time. The syntax for setInterval is as follows:

<!-- <div class="clock"></div> -->
The function parameter is the name of the function to be called or a block of code to be executed at each interval. The interval parameter is the number of milliseconds between each call of the function.

Here's an example of how to use setInterval():

 <h1>Tutor Joes</h1>
JavaScript code

let clockDiv = document.querySelector(".clock");
clockDiv.style.fontSize = "30px";
function clock() {
  const date = new Date();

  const time = date.getHours() + " : " + date.getMinutes() + " : " + date.getSeconds() + " : " + date.getMilliseconds();
  clockDiv.innerHTML = time;
}

setInterval(clock, 1000);
Using setInterval can be useful for creating animations, updating data on a webpage, or performing any other task that needs to be repeated at regular intervals. However, it's important to use it judiciously, as excessive use of setInterval can lead to performance issues or excessive resource consumption.

Selects an HTML element with the class "clock" using the querySelector() method and stores it in the clockDiv variable.
Sets the font size of the selected element to 30 pixels using the style property and the fontSize attribute.
Defines a function named clock() that uses the Date object to get the current time and format it as a string.
Updates the innerHTML property of the clockDiv element with the current time string using the clock() function.
Calls the clock() function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the setInterval() method.

        <summary>Managing HTML Element Attributes with ClassList and Attribute Methods in JavaScript</summary>
        <pre>
          In JavaScript, the classList and attribute methods are used for manipulating the class and attribute values of an HTML element.

The classList method provides a set of built-in functions that allow developers to add, remove, or toggle class names of an element. These functions include add(), remove(), toggle(), and contains(). Using these functions, you can easily change the appearance and behavior of an element based on user interaction or other events.

On the other hand, the attribute method provides a way to get, set, or remove the attribute value of an element. This method accepts one or two parameters: the first parameter is the name of the attribute, and the second parameter (optional) is the new value of the attribute.

classList
The classList property returns a DOMTokenList object, which represents the class attribute of an element as a collection of space-separated tokens. You can use the methods of this object to manipulate the classes of the element.Here are some common methods of the classList object

Adding a class
The add() method belongs to the classList property, which is available on all HTML elements. You can use the add() method to add a new class name to the list of classes that an element already has.

Note that if the element already has a class name that you're trying to add, the add() method will ignore that class name and not add it again. This ensures that each class name in the list of classes is unique.

To add a new class to an element, you can use the add() method. For example:

<!-- <div class="box">Box</div> -->
JavaScript Code

const btnAdd = document.querySelector("#btnAdd");
btnAdd.addEventListener("click", function () {
  box.classList.add("new-color");
});
This line of code selects the button with an id of "btnAdd" using the querySelector() method and stores it in a variable called btnAdd.
Next adds an event listener to the btnAdd button using the addEventListener() method. The event that we're listening for is a "click" event, which fires when the button is clicked.
The second argument to addEventListener() is a function that will be executed when the event is triggered. In this case, we're passing in an anonymous function that will add a new CSS class to a box with an unknown id.
We're adding the CSS class "new-color" to the box using the classList.add() method. This will apply a new style to the box, changing its background color to whatever is defined in the "new-color" CSS class.
Note that the box variable isn't defined in this code snippet, so it's unclear what element this code is targeting. However, assuming that there is an HTML element with a class attribute of "box" on the page, this code would add a new CSS class of "new-color" to that element when the "btnAdd" button is clicked.
Removing a class
classList.remove() is a method in JavaScript that allows you to remove one or more CSS classes from an HTML element.

The remove() method belongs to the classList property, which is available on all HTML elements. You can use the remove() method to remove a class name from the list of classes that an element already has.The remove() method belongs to the classList property, which is available on all HTML elements. You can use the remove() method to remove a class name from the list of classes that an element already has.

Note that if the element doesn't have a class name that you're trying to remove, the remove() method will ignore that class name and not throw an error.

To remove a class from an element, you can use the remove() method. For example:

<!-- <button id="btnRemove">Remove</button> -->
JavaScript Code

const btnRemove = document.querySelector("#btnRemove");
btnRemove.addEventListener("click", function () {
  box.classList.remove("new-color");
});
This code adds an event listener to a button with an id of "btnRemove" and removes a CSS class from a box when the button is clicked.
The code selects the button with an id of "btnRemove" using the querySelector() method and stores it in a variable called btnRemove.
This code adds an event listener to the btnRemove button using the addEventListener() method. The event that we're listening for is a "click" event, which fires when the button is clicked.
The second argument to addEventListener() is a function that will be executed when the event is triggered. In this case, we're passing in an anonymous function that will remove a CSS class from a box with an unknown id.
We're removing the CSS class "new-color" from the box using the classList.remove() method. This will remove the style that was previously applied to the box by the "new-color" CSS class, changing its background color back to whatever it was before the "new-color" class was added.
Note that the box variable isn't defined in this code snippet, so it's unclear what element this code is targeting. However, assuming that there is an HTML element with a class attribute of "box" on the page, this code would remove the "new-color" CSS class from that element when the "btnRemove" button is clicked.
Toggling a class
The toggle() method belongs to the classList property, which is available on all HTML elements. You can use the toggle() method to add a class name to an element if it doesn't have it, or remove it if it already has it.

Note that the toggle() method returns a boolean value that indicates whether the class was added or removed. If the class was added, the method returns true. If the class was removed, the method returns false.

You can also use the toggle() method to conditionally add or remove a class based on a boolean value..

To toggle a class on an element (i.e., add it if it doesn't exist, remove it if it does), you can use the toggle() method. For example:

<!-- <button id="btnToggle">Toggle</button> -->
JavaScript Code

const btnToggle = document.querySelector("#btnToggle");
btnToggle.addEventListener("click", function () {
  box.classList.toggle("new-color");
});
This line of code selects the button with an id of "btnToggle" using the querySelector() method and stores it in a variable called btnToggle.
This code adds an event listener to the btnToggle button using the addEventListener() method. The event that we're listening for is a "click" event, which fires when the button is clicked.
The second argument to addEventListener() is a function that will be executed when the event is triggered. In this case, we're passing in an anonymous function that will toggle a CSS class on and off a box with an unknown id.
We're toggling the CSS class "new-color" on and off the box using the classList.toggle() method. This method will add the "new-color" class to the box if it doesn't have it, or remove it if it does have it.
Assuming that there is an HTML element with a class attribute of "box" on the page, this code would toggle the "new-color" CSS class on and off that element when the "btnToggle" button is clicked.
Attribute
In JavaScript, the getAttribute() and setAttribute() methods are used to get and set attributes on an HTML element, respectively.

Getting an attribute value
To get the value of an attribute on an element, you can use the getAttribute() method.The getAttribute() method takes a single argument, which is the name of the attribute you want to get the value of. If the specified attribute doesn't exist on the element, the getAttribute() method will return null.Note that if the attribute you want to get is a standard HTML attribute, like href, src, or class, you can also access them directly as properties on the HTML element

However, if you want to get the value of a custom data attribute, you must use the getAttribute() method.

Setting an attribute value
To set the value of an attribute on an element, you can use the setAttribute() method.The setAttribute() method is used to set the value of a specified attribute on an HTML element.The setAttribute() method takes two arguments: the name of the attribute you want to set, and the value you want to set it to.

If the specified attribute doesn't already exist on the element, the setAttribute() method will create it. If the attribute already exists, the method will replace its value with the new value.Note that you can also set the value of standard HTML attributes, like href, class, or id, by directly setting their corresponding properties on the HTML element.

However, if you want to set the value of a custom data attribute, you must use the setAttribute() method.

For Example

<!-- <input type="text" id="txtName" class="apple" name="name" />
<button id="btnClick">Click</button> -->
JavaScript Code

const btnClick = document.querySelector("#btnClick");
const input = document.querySelector("input");

btnClick.addEventListener("click", function () {
  const getAtt = input.getAttribute("type");
  if (getAtt == "text") {
    input.setAttribute("type", "password");
  } else {
    input.setAttribute("type", "text");
  }
});
his JavaScript code adds a click event listener to a button with the ID "btnClick". When the button is clicked, the code retrieves the "type" attribute of an input element and checks if it equals "text". If it does, the code sets the "type" attribute of the input element to "password". If it doesn't, the code sets the "type" attribute to "text". This code allows a user to toggle between hiding and showing the value of a password input field.

The const keyword is used to declare two variables: btnClick and input. btnClick is assigned the value of the HTML element with the ID "btnClick", which is a button element in this case. input is assigned the value of the first HTML input element on the page.
The addEventListener() method is used to attach a click event listener to the btnClick element. The second argument of this method is a callback function that will be executed when the button is clicked.
Inside the callback function, the getAttribute() method is used to get the current value of the type attribute of the input element, which is initially set to "text".
The if statement checks if the value of getAtt is equal to "text". If it is, the setAttribute() method is used to change the value of the type attribute to "password". If it isn't, the setAttribute() method is used to change the value of the type attribute to "text".
When the user clicks the button, the value of the type attribute of the input element is toggled between "text" and "password", allowing the user to toggle the visibility of the password in the input field.
Note that this method is not supported in Internet Explorer or some older browsers, so you may want to check for its availability before using it. One way to do this is to use the typeof operator to check if the method exists on the element

Removing an attribute value
The removeAttribute() method takes a single argument, which is the name of the attribute you want to remove.If the specified attribute doesn't exist on the element, the removeAttribute() method will do nothing.

Note that you can also remove standard HTML attributes, like href, class, or id, by setting their corresponding properties on the HTML element to null.

However, if you want to remove a custom data attribute, you must use the removeAttribute() method.

To remove an attribute from an element, you can use the removeAttribute() method. For example:

<!-- <input type="text" id="txtName" class="apple" name="name" /> -->
JavaScript Code

const input = document.querySelector("input");
input.removeAttribute("name");
hasAttribute()
The hasAttribute() method takes a single argument, which is the name of the attribute you want to check.

If the specified attribute exists on the element, the hasAttribute() method will return true. If the attribute does not exist, the method will return false.

Note that you can also check for standard HTML attributes, like href, class, or id, by checking their corresponding properties on the HTML element.

However, if you want to check for a custom data attribute, you must use the hasAttribute() method.

For example:

<!-- <input type="text" id="txtName" class="apple" name="name" /> -->
JavaScript Code

console.log(input.hasAttribute("class"));
getAttributeNames()
The getAttributeNames() method in JavaScript is used to retrieve an array of all attribute names of an HTML element.

Note that this method is not supported in Internet Explorer or some older browsers, so you may want to check for its availability before using it. One way to do this is to use the typeof operator to check if the method exists on the element:

        <summary>Mastering Mouse Events in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide</summary>
        <pre>
          Mouse events in JavaScript are events that are triggered by mouse interactions on a web page. These events allow developers to capture and respond to user actions involving the mouse, such as clicking, moving, hovering, and dragging.

Mouse events in JavaScript are events that are triggered by mouse interactions on a web page. These events allow developers to capture and respond to user actions involving the mouse, such as clicking, moving, hovering, and dragging.

"click": This event is triggered when the user clicks (presses and releases) a mouse button on an element. It can be used to detect when a user clicks on a button, link, or any other clickable element on a web page.
"mousemove": This event is triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element. It can be used to track the movement of the mouse and respond accordingly, such as updating the position of an element or creating interactive elements that follow the mouse cursor.
"mouseover" and "mouseout": These events are triggered when the mouse pointer enters or exits an element, respectively. They are commonly used to implement hover effects or tooltips that appear when the mouse pointer is over a certain element.
"mousedown" and "mouseup": These events are triggered when the user presses and releases a mouse button on an element, respectively. They can be used to detect when a user starts or stops clicking on an element, which is useful for implementing drag-and-drop functionality or other interactive behaviors.
"ondblclick": This event is triggered when the user double clicks (presses and releases) a mouse button on an element. It can be used to detect when a user double clicks on a button, link, or any other clickable element on a web page.
click
In JavaScript, the "click" event is triggered when a user presses and releases a mouse button on an element, typically the left button, within a short time frame. The "click" event is one of the most commonly used mouse events and is often used to capture user interactions with clickable elements on a web page, such as buttons, links, and images.

To handle the "click" event in JavaScript, an event listener can be attached to the target element using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods. The event listener is a function that is executed when the "click" event occurs on the specified element.

Here's an example of how to handle the "click" event using JavaScript:

<!-- <button onclick="alert('Welcome to Tutor Joes')">Inline event</button> -->
It creates an HTML button element with an onclick attribute that specifies a JavaScript code snippet to be executed when the button is clicked.

The onclick attribute is an example of an event handler in HTML, and it is used to define the behavior or action to be taken when a specific event, in this case, a click event, occurs on the HTML element to which it is attached.

In this case, when the button is clicked, the JavaScript code snippet alert('Welcome to Tutor Joes')will be executed. The alert() function is a built-in JavaScript function that displays a popup dialog box with the message "Welcome to Tutor Joes" as its content.

ondblclick
ondblclick is an event handler attribute in JavaScript that is used to detect when an element is double-clicked by the user. It is commonly used in HTML to define an action or behavior to be executed when an element is double-clicked.

Here's an example of how to handle the "ondblclick" event using JavaScript:

<!-- <button class="btn">Event</button> -->
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

btn.addEventListener("dblclick", function () {
  alert("Your are dblclicked");
});
mousemove
The "mousemove" event is a mouse event in JavaScript that is triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element. It is often used to track the movement of the mouse and respond accordingly, such as updating the position of an element or creating interactive elements that follow the mouse cursor.

To handle the "mousemove" event in JavaScript, an event listener can be attached to the target element using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods. The event listener is a function that is executed whenever the mouse pointer moves over the specified element.

Here's an example of how to handle the "mousemove" event using JavaScript:

<!-- <button class="btn">Event</button> -->
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

btn.addEventListener("mousemove", function () {
  this.style.backgroundColor = "purple";
});
mouseover
The "mouseover" event is a mouse event in JavaScript that is triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element or one of its child elements. It is often used to detect when the mouse pointer enters a particular element, and is commonly used for creating hover effects, tooltips, or other interactive elements that respond to mouse movements.

To handle the "mouseover" event in JavaScript, an event listener can be attached to the target element using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods. The event listener is a function that is executed when the mouse pointer moves over the specified element or its child elements.

Here's an example of how to handle the "mouseover" event using JavaScript:

<!-- <button class="btn">Event</button> -->
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

btn.addEventListener("mouseover", function () {
  this.style.backgroundColor = "orange";
});
mouseout
The "mouseout" event is a mouse event in JavaScript that is triggered when the mouse pointer moves out of an element or one of its child elements. It is often used to detect when the mouse pointer leaves a particular element, and is commonly used for creating hover effects, tooltips, or other interactive elements that respond to mouse movements.

To handle the "mouseout" event in JavaScript, an event listener can be attached to the target element using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods. The event listener is a function that is executed when the mouse pointer moves out of the specified element or its child elements.

Here's an example of how to handle the "mouseout" event using JavaScript:

<!-- <button class="btn">Event</button> -->
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

btn.addEventListener("mouseout", function () {
  this.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
});
mousedown
The "mousedown" event is a mouse event in JavaScript that is triggered when a mouse button is pressed down on an element. It is often used to detect when a user begins to click or interact with an element using the mouse.

To handle the "mousedown" event in JavaScript, an event listener can be attached to the target element using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods. The event listener is a function that is executed when a mouse button is pressed down on the specified element.

Here's an example of how to handle the "mousedown" event using JavaScript:

<!-- <button class="btn">Event</button> -->
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

btn.addEventListener("mousedown", function () {
  this.style.backgroundColor = "red";
});
mouseup
The "mouseup" event is a mouse event in JavaScript that is triggered when a mouse button is released after being pressed down on an element. It is often used to detect when a user finishes clicking or interacting with an element using the mouse.

To handle the "mouseup" event in JavaScript, an event listener can be attached to the target element using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods. The event listener is a function that is executed when a mouse button is released on the specified element.

Here's an example of how to handle the "mouseup" event using JavaScript:

<!-- <button class="btn">Event</button> -->
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

btn.addEventListener("mouseup", function () {
  this.style.backgroundColor = "red";

        <summary>Mastering Keyboard Events in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide</summary>
        <pre>
          Keyboard events in JavaScript are events that are triggered when a user interacts with the keyboard, such as pressing a key, releasing a key, or typing a key. These events allow web developers to capture and respond to user input from the keyboard in web applications.

There are three main types of keyboard events in JavaScript:

keydown event: This event is triggered when a key is initially pressed down on the keyboard. It occurs when the physical key is first pressed down, and it may be triggered repeatedly if the key is held down.
keyup event: This event is triggered when a key is released after being pressed down on the keyboard. It occurs when the physical key is released, and it is only triggered once when the key is released.
keypress event: This event is triggered when a key that represents a character value is actually typed by the user. It occurs after the keydown event and before the keyup event, and it is typically used to capture character input, such as in text fields or other input elements.
key property: The key property of the event object represents the physical key that was pressed or released during a keyboard event.
code property: The code property of the event object represents the physical key that was pressed or released during a keyboard event, as a standardized string value that does not depend on the keyboard layout or locale.
To handle keyboard events in JavaScript, event listeners can be attached to the target element using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods. The event listeners are functions that are executed when a keyboard event is triggered on the specified element.

Keydown
The keydown event is a keyboard event that is triggered when a key is initially pressed down by the user. It is commonly used in JavaScript to capture and handle user input from the keyboard. The keydown event is fired when the physical key is pressed down, regardless of whether the key is subsequently held down or released.

Here's an example of how to handle the "Keydown" event using JavaScript:

 <!-- <label for="input-num">Enter a Number</label>
 <input type="text" id="input-num" /> -->

/*document.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyEvent);

function handleKeyEvent(event) {
  const eventType = event.type;
  console.log(`Event type: ${eventType}`);
}
*/

const input = document.getElementById("input-num");
const msg = document.getElementById("error");

input.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  const key = event.key;
  console.log(key);
  if (isNaN(key)) {
    event.preventDefault();
    msg.textContent = "Please Enter Number only";
  } else {
    msg.textContent = "";
  }
});
The code snippet provided demonstrates how to handle the keydown event in JavaScript to validate user input in an input field with an ID of "input-num" and display an error message in an element with an ID of "error" if the input is not a number.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The keydown event is attached to the document object with an event listener function handleKeyEvent using the addEventListener method. This function will be executed whenever a key is pressed down on the keyboard.
The handleKeyEvent function logs the type of the event (keydown) to the console.
The input element with an ID of "input-num" is selected using document.getElementById and an event listener function is attached to it using addEventListener method.
The event listener function for the keydown event on the input element takes an event parameter, which represents the event object that contains information about the keydown event, such as the key that was pressed (event.key).
The key property of the event object is retrieved and logged to the console. This property represents the value of the key that was pressed, such as a letter, number, or symbol.
The isNaN function is used to check if the key value is not a number. If it is not a number, event.preventDefault() is called to prevent the input from accepting non-numeric characters.
If the key value is not a number, an error message is displayed in the element with an ID of "error" using the textContent property. Otherwise, the error message is cleared by setting the textContent property to an empty string.
This code can be used to ensure that only numeric input is accepted in the "input-num" field and display an error message if any non-numeric characters are entered. Note that the keydown event is used in this example, which triggers when a key is initially pressed down, but it may not capture certain non-character keys (such as arrow keys, function keys, etc.). Depending on your use case, you may need to consider using other keyboard events such as keypress or input for more robust input validation.

It's important to be mindful of accessibility considerations when using keydown event listeners, as some keys may have special functions or mappings in certain assistive technologies or input methods. Also, keep in mind that different browsers may have slightly different behavior and support for certain keys or key combinations, so it's recommended to test and verify the behavior across different browsers and devices when using the keydown event in your web applications.

keypress (deprecated)
The keypress event is a keyboard event that is triggered when a key is initially pressed down and a character is generated by the key, typically resulting in a printable character being displayed on the screen. It is commonly used in JavaScript to capture and handle user input from the keyboard when printable characters are typed, such as letters, numbers, and symbols.

Here's an example of how to handle the "keypress" event using JavaScript:

 <!-- <label for="input-num">Enter a Number</label>
 <input type="text" id="input-num" /> -->
const input = document.getElementById("input-num");
const msg = document.getElementById("error");

input.addEventListener("keypress", function (event) {
  const key = event.key;
  console.log(key);
  if (isNaN(key)) {
    event.preventDefault();
    msg.textContent = "Please Enter Number only";
  } else {
    msg.textContent = "";
  }
});
Please note that the keypress event is being deprecated in favor of the input event in modern web standards, as it provides more consistent and reliable input handling across different devices and input methods. However, the keypress event may still be used in older or legacy web applications, or in specific use cases where printable character input is required.

keyup
The keyup event in JavaScript is triggered when a key is released after being pressed down on the keyboard. It is one of the keyboard events that can be used to detect when a specific key is released by the user.

Here's an example of how to handle the "keyup" event using JavaScript:

 <!-- <label for="input-num">Enter a Number</label>
 <input type="text" id="input-num" /> -->
document.addEventListener("keyup", handleKeyEvent);

function handleKeyEvent(event) {
  const eventType = event.type;
  console.log(`Event type: ${eventType}`);
}

key
In JavaScript, the key property is a property of the event object that represents the value of the key that was pressed or released during a keyboard event. It provides information about the specific key that triggered the event, such as a letter, number, or special character.

The key property returns a string that represents the value of the key in a human-readable format, regardless of whether the key is uppercase or lowercase.

The key property is commonly used in keyboard event handlers to determine which key was pressed or released, and to perform different actions based on the value of the key.

Here's an example of how to handle the "key" property using JavaScript:
<!-- 
 <label for="input-num">Enter a Number</label>
 <input type="text" id="input-num" /> -->
document.addEventListener("keyup", handleKeyEvent);

function handleKeyEvent(event) {
  const keyName = event.key;
  console.log(`Key name: ${keyName}`);
}
code
The "code" property may refer to a custom property that has been added to a DOM element by a developer using their own JavaScript code. In JavaScript, it's possible to add custom properties to DOM elements or any other JavaScript objects by simply assigning a value to a property that doesn't already exist on the object.

Here's an example of how to handle the "code" event using JavaScript:

 <!-- <label for="input-num">Enter a Number</label>
 <input type="text" id="input-num" /> -->
document.addEventListener("keyup", handleKeyEvent);

function handleKeyEvent(event) {
  const keyCode = event.code;
  console.log(`Key code: ${keyCode}`);
}

        <summary>Handling Form Events in JavaScript: Examples and Best Practices</summary>
        <pre>
          Form events in JavaScript are events that are triggered when a user interacts with a form on a web page. These events allow you to capture and respond to user actions, such as submitting a form, entering data into form fields, or resetting a form.

Here are some commonly used form events in JavaScript:

submit: This event is triggered when a form is submitted, either by clicking a submit button or pressing the Enter key within a form field. You can use this event to perform form validation, submit form data to a server, or handle other form-related tasks.
input: This event is triggered when the value of a form field is changed by the user. This includes events such as typing in a text input, selecting an option in a dropdown, or changing the value of a checkbox or radio button. You can use this event to dynamically update the form or perform real-time validation.
change: This event is triggered when the value of a form field is changed and the field loses focus. This includes events such as selecting an option in a dropdown or changing the value of a checkbox or radio button. You can use this event to capture changes made by the user and perform tasks accordingly.
reset: This event is triggered when a form is reset, either by clicking a reset button or programmatically resetting the form using JavaScript. You can use this event to perform cleanup tasks or reset the form's state.
focus : The focus event is triggered when an element, such as a form field, receives focus. This typically occurs when the user clicks or tabs into an input field.
checked : The checked property is used to determine whether a checkbox or a radio button is checked or not. It is a boolean property that returns true if the element is checked, and false if it is not checked.
blur : The checked property is used to determine whether a checkbox or a radio button is checked or not. It is a boolean property that returns true if the element is checked, and false if it is not checked.
To handle form events in JavaScript, you can use event listeners or event handlers. Event listeners are functions that are registered to listen for specific events on specific DOM elements, while event handlers are functions that are directly assigned to handle specific events. These functions can be written in JavaScript and can manipulate the DOM, validate form data, and perform other actions based on the user's interactions with the form.

Form events in JavaScript are an essential part of building interactive and dynamic web forms that provide a smooth user experience. Properly handling form events can help you create robust and user-friendly web forms that are responsive to user input and behavior.

The provided code demonstrates the use of various form events in JavaScript, along with some related event listeners and event handling functions. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

Form submit event: The submit event is triggered when the form is submitted. In the code, an event listener is added to the form element, and when the form is submitted, the event handling function prevents the default form submission behavior using e.preventDefault(), and logs the form data including the values of the username, email, and gender fields to the console.
Form reset event: The reset event is triggered when the form is reset. In the code, an event listener is added to the form element, and when the form is reset, the event handling function logs a message to the console indicating that the form data has been cleared.
change event: The change event is triggered when the value of a form field, such as a select element, is changed. In the code, an event listener is added to the course select element, and when the selected course is changed, the event handling function logs the selected course value to the console.
checked property: The checked property is used to determine whether a checkbox or a radio button is checked or not. In the code, an event listener is added to the checkbox element, and when the checkbox is checked or unchecked, the event handling function logs a message to the console accordingly.
input event: The input event is triggered when the value of an input field, such as a text input or textarea, is changed. In the code, an event listener is added to the username input element, and when the username input is changed, the event handling function logs the changed value to the console.
focus and blur events: The focus event is triggered when an element receives focus, and the blur event is triggered when an element loses focus. In the code, event listeners are added to the username input element, and when the input element receives focus, the border color is changed to orange, and when it loses focus, the border color is changed back to black.
In summary, the provided code demonstrates the use of form events in JavaScript, including submit, reset, change, checked, input, focus, and blur events, along with their corresponding event listeners and event handling functions. These events and event handling functions can be used to create dynamic and interactive forms in web applications.

        <summary>Mastering Touch Events in JavaScript: Techniques and Best Practices</summary>
        <pre>
          Touch events are a type of event that can be triggered on touch-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablets, using JavaScript. They allow web developers to respond to user interactions, such as tapping, swiping, and pinching, on touchscreens.

There are several touch events available in JavaScript, including:

touchstart: This event is triggered when a finger or stylus is first placed on the touch screen.
touchmove: This event is triggered when a finger or stylus is moved across the touch screen.
touchend: This event is triggered when a finger or stylus is lifted off the touch screen.
touchcancel: This event is triggered if the touch event is cancelled, such as when the touch is interrupted by an incoming call or other system event.
Each touch event provides information about the touch point, including the position (in pixels) relative to the viewport, the target element being touched, and other details such as the number of touches and their identifiers.

To handle touch events in JavaScript, you can use event listeners that are attached to the DOM elements you want to capture touch events from. For example, you can use the addEventListener method to listen for touch events on an element, and then use event handlers to execute custom code when touch events occur.

Here's an example of how you can use JavaScript to handle a touch event:

const touchArea = document.getElementById("touchArea");

touchArea.addEventListener("touchstart", function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  touchArea.textContent = "Touch Started !";
});

  e.preventDefault();
  touchArea.style.backgroundColor = "red";
  touchArea.textContent = "Touch Cancelled !";
});


The provided code sets up event listeners for touch events on an element with the id "touchArea" using JavaScript. Let's go through each event listener and what it does:

touchstart: This event listener is triggered when a finger or stylus is first placed on the touch screen. It prevents the default behavior of the touchstart event using e.preventDefault(), which can prevent unintended actions such as scrolling. It then sets the background color of the "touchArea" element to blue and updates its text content to "Touch Started !".
touchmove: This event listener is triggered when a finger or stylus is moved across the touch screen. It also prevents the default behavior of the touchmove event using e.preventDefault(). It sets the background color of the "touchArea" element to green and updates its text content to "Touch Moved !".
touchend: This event listener is triggered when a finger or stylus is lifted off the touch screen. It prevents the default behavior of the touchend event using e.preventDefault(). It sets the background color of the "touchArea" element to gray and updates its text content to "Touch Ended !".
touchcancel: This event listener is triggered if the touch event is cancelled, such as when the touch is interrupted by an incoming call or other system event. It prevents the default behavior of the touchcancel event using e.preventDefault(). It sets the background color of the "touchArea" element to red and updates its text content to "Touch Cancelled !".
Note that in each event listener, the e parameter represents the touch event object, which contains information about the touch event, such as the target element, touch coordinates, and other details. By using event listeners for touch events, you can respond to user interactions on touch-enabled devices and customize the behavior of your web application accordingly.

It's important to note that touch events are different from mouse events, and may require additional considerations for handling gestures, multi-touch interactions, and performance optimization on touch-enabled devices. Proper handling of touch events can greatly enhance the user experience of a touch-enabled web application.

        <summary>Touch the Target: A Simple JavaScript Touch Event Game</summary>
        <pre>
          Touch events are events that are triggered when a user interacts with a touch-enabled device, such as a smartphone or a tablet. These events allow you to capture touch gestures, such as tapping, swiping, and dragging, and use them to build interactive web applications or games.

Here's a step-by-step guide to create a simple touch-based game using JavaScript:

Step 1: Set up HTML Markup

First, you'll need to set up the HTML markup for your game. For example, you can create a simple game container with a canvas element where you'll draw the game graphics. You can also create any additional HTML elements, such as buttons or score displays, that you'll need for your game.

        padding: 0;
        box-sizing: border-box;
        font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
      }
      h3 {
        font-weight: 600;
        text-transform: uppercase;
      }
      #game {
        width: 400px;
        height: 200px;
        background-color: #ddd;
        position: relative;
      }
      #ball {
        width: 25px;
        height: 25px;
        background-color: red;
        border-radius: 25px;
        position: absolute;
        top: 75px;
        left: 75px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

    <h3>Simple Ball Game</h3>
    <div id="game">
      <div id="ball"></div>
    </div>
    <script src="touch.js"></script>
  </body>
</html> -->
Step 2: Set up JavaScript File

Next, you'll need to create a JavaScript file (e.g., "touch.js") that will contain the game logic. In this file, you can define variables to store game state, such as the player's score or the game objects' positions. You can also set up an event listener for touch events.

Step 3: Handle Touch Events

In the event listener functions, you can access information about the touch events, such as the position of the touch on the screen. You can use this information to update your game state, such as moving game objects or detecting collisions.

touch.js

const game = document.getElementById("game");
const ball = document.getElementById("ball");
let startX, startY;

game.addEventListener("touchstart", function (e) {
  const touch = e.changedTouches[0];
  startX = touch.clientX;
  startY = touch.clientY;
});

game.addEventListener("touchmove", function (e) {
  const touch = e.changedTouches[0];
  const diffX = touch.clientX - startX;
  const diffY = touch.clientY - startY;
  ball.style.left = Math.max(0, Math.min(350, ball.offsetLeft + diffX)) + "px";
  ball.style.top = Math.max(0, Math.min(180, ball.offsetTop + diffY)) + "px";
  startX = touch.clientX;
  startY = touch.clientY;
  e.preventDefault();
});


This code sets up touch event listeners for a simple game where a ball can be moved around within a container element with id "game". Let's go through it step by step:

The touchstart event listener is set up on the "game" element. When a touch event starts (i.e., a user touches the screen), the event handler function is triggered.
Inside the touchstart event handler function, the changedTouches property of the event object is used to get information about the first touch point (in this case, e.changedTouches[0]). The clientX and clientY properties of the touch point represent the initial touch coordinates, which are stored in startX and startY variables for later use.
The touchmove event listener is set up on the "game" element as well. When a touch event moves (i.e., a user moves their finger on the screen), the event handler function is triggered.
Inside the touchmove event handler function, the changedTouches property of the event object is used again to get information about the touch point that has moved. The clientX and clientY properties of the touch point represent the current touch coordinates.
The difference between the current touch coordinates and the initial touch coordinates (diffX and diffY) is calculated to determine how much the ball should be moved horizontally and vertically.
The style.left and style.top properties of the "ball" element are updated to change its position on the screen. The Math.max and Math.min functions are used to limit the ball's position within the boundaries of the "game" element, so that it doesn't move outside of the visible area.
The startX and startY variables are updated with the current touch coordinates, so that they can be used as the initial touch coordinates in the next touchmove event.
Finally, e.preventDefault() is called to prevent any default behavior of touch events, such as scrolling or zooming, to ensure smooth handling of the game's touch controls.
Note: The "ball" element is assumed to exist in the HTML markup and has an initial position set using CSS. The code provided only handles the touch events for moving the ball and does not include any game logic or additional features.

        <summary>Mastering Promises in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide</summary>
        <pre>
          In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It provides a cleaner and more efficient way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

A Promise has three states:

Pending: The initial state when a Promise is created. The asynchronous operation is still in progress, and the Promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The state when the asynchronous operation is completed successfully. The Promise has a resulting value associated with it, which can be accessed using the .then() method.
Rejected: The state when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or is rejected explicitly. The Promise has a reason or error associated with it, which can be accessed using the .catch() method.
Promises can be used to handle various asynchronous operations such as fetching data from APIs, making HTTP requests, reading/writing files, and more. Promises can be chained together using the .then() method, allowing for sequential execution of asynchronous operations. Additionally, Promises can be combined using methods like Promise.all() and Promise.race() to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.

ES6 introduced the async/await syntax, which is built on top of Promises and provides a more concise way to write asynchronous code. async functions return Promises, and await is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until the Promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Key features of Promises in JavaScript:

Asynchronous handling: Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable manner.
Error handling: Promises have built-in error handling through the .catch() method, allowing for centralized error handling.
Chaining: Promises can be chained together using the .then() method, allowing for sequential execution of asynchronous operations.
Concurrency: Promises can be combined using methods like Promise.all() and Promise.race() to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.
Compatibility: Promises are widely supported in modern JavaScript environments and can be used in both browser-based and server-side JavaScript applications.
Overall, Promises in JavaScript provide a powerful tool for managing asynchronous code, making it more manageable, readable, and error-resistant.

then()
then() is a method available on Promise objects. It is used to attach callbacks or handlers that will be executed when a Promise is fulfilled, i.e., when the asynchronous operation associated with the Promise completes successfully.

The syntax for using then() is as follows:

promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
where promise is the Promise object, onFulfilled is a callback function that will be executed when the Promise is fulfilled, and onRejected is an optional callback function that will be executed when the Promise is rejected

The onFulfilled callback function will receive the resolved value of the Promise as its first argument. If the Promise does not have a resolved value, onFulfilled will receive undefined. The onRejected callback function, if provided, will receive the reason or error associated with the rejected Promise as its first argument.

resolve and reject
The resolve and reject functions are provided as arguments to the Promise constructor, and they are used to fulfill or reject the Promise, respectively, when the asynchronous operation completes.

          Normal Functions
          function welcome() {
            return "Hello World";
          }
          console.log(welcome());
          The provided code defines a function named welcome without any parameters.
          
          Inside the function body, the return statement is used to specify the value that will be returned when the function is called. In this case, the string "Hello World" is returned.
          
          The console.log() function is used to display the result of calling the welcome function. By invoking welcome() within the parentheses of console.log() , the function is executed, and its return value, which is "Hello World" , is printed to the console.
          
          So when you run this code, you will see the output "Hello World" printed in the console.
          
          Async in JavaScript
          In JavaScript, async and await are keywords used to simplify asynchronous programming and make it more readable and concise. They were introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) as a way to work with Promises, which are objects used for managing asynchronous operations.
          
          The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. An asynchronous function is a function that implicitly returns a Promise, allowing it to use the await keyword inside its body. It allows you to write code that appears to be synchronous while actually executing asynchronously.
          
          Example
          
          async function welcome() {
            return "Hello World";
          }
          console.log(welcome());
          The provided code defines an asynchronous function named welcome using the async keyword. The function body includes a return statement that returns the string "Hello World".
          
          When the function welcome() is called, it returns a Promise that will resolve with the value "Hello World". However, in the code provided, the console.log(welcome()) statement does not directly display the resolved value because the function is asynchronous.
          
          Instead, the Promise returned by welcome() is logged to the console. This will display something like Promise {<pending>} indicating that a Promise object is being returned, but it has not yet been resolved.
          
          Since the function is asynchronous, it will continue executing in the background while the Promise is pending. The code will not block and wait for the Promise to resolve before moving on to the next line.
          
          then()
          In JavaScript, the then() method is used in conjunction with Promises to handle the fulfillment or rejection of a Promise and to chain asynchronous operations together.
          
          When an asynchronous operation is performed, it returns a Promise object. The then() method is called on that Promise object and takes two optional callback functions as arguments: onFulfilled and onRejected. These callbacks are executed based on the state of the Promise.
          
          Here's the general syntax for using then():
          
          promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
          The onFulfilled callback is executed when the Promise is successfully fulfilled (resolved). It receives the resolved value as an argument. The onRejected callback is executed when the Promise is rejected, typically when an error occurs during the asynchronous operation. It receives the reason for the rejection (usually an error object) as an argument.
          
          If you want to access the resolved value of the Promise, you can use the then() method to attach a callback function that will be executed when the Promise is fulfilled.
          
          welcome().then((msg) => {
              console.log(msg);
          })
          In this case, the callback function will receive the resolved value "Hello World" as the msg parameter and log it to the console.
          
          So, in summary, the provided code logs the Promise object returned by the welcome() function, indicating that it is pending and will eventually resolve with the value "Hello World". To access and log the resolved value, you need to use the then() method or await the Promise in an async context.
          
          catch()
          In JavaScript, the catch() method is used in conjunction with Promises to handle errors or rejections that occur during the execution of asynchronous operations. It is specifically designed to handle the rejected state of a Promise.
          
          When an error occurs within a Promise or the Promise is explicitly rejected using the reject() function, the catch() method is used to specify a callback function that will be executed to handle the error.
          
          Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of catch() in an async function:
          
          async function welcome() {
            return "Hello World";
          }
          console.log(welcome());
          
          welcome()
            .then((msg) => {
              console.log(msg);
            })
            .catch((err) => {
              console.error(err);
            });
          The provided code demonstrates the usage of an async function and the handling of its returned Promise using then() and catch() methods.
          
          The function welcome is declared as an asynchronous function using the async keyword. It has no parameters and includes a return statement that returns the string "Hello World".
          
          When the welcome() function is called, it returns a Promise that will be immediately fulfilled with the value "Hello World".
          
          The code console.log(welcome()) logs the Promise object returned by welcome() to the console. This will display something like Promise {<fulfilled>: "Hello World"}. However, since the Promise is immediately fulfilled, it doesn't need to wait for any asynchronous operation to complete.
          
          To access the resolved value of the Promise, the code uses the then() method to attach a callback function that will be executed when the Promise is fulfilled. In this case, the callback function receives the resolved value "Hello World" as the msg parameter and logs it to the console using console.log(msg) .
          
          In the given code, since the Promise is immediately fulfilled, the then() callback is executed synchronously after the console.log(welcome()) statement. It directly logs "Hello World" to the console.
          
          The catch() method is also chained after then() to handle any errors that might occur during the Promise execution. However, since the Promise is immediately fulfilled and there are no asynchronous operations or rejections happening, the catch() callback will not be triggered.
          
          In summary, the code logs the Promise object returned by welcome() to the console, then immediately logs the resolved value "Hello World" using then() . Since there are no errors or rejections, the catch() callback is not executed in this case.
          
          Creating Comments for Blog using Async/Await Function
          Creating comments for a blog using async/await functions in JavaScript involves implementing asynchronous operations to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for comments.
          
          Here's a general outline of how you can approach this task:
          
          Set up a data structure or a database to store the comments for your blog. This can be an array, an object, or a database collection.
          Define an async function, let's say blogComment, to create a new comment for the blog. This function will receive the necessary data for the comment.
          Within the blogComment function, you can perform any necessary validation or data processing before creating the comment.
          Use the await keyword to handle asynchronous operations within the function.
          In case of any errors during the asynchronous operations, use try and catch to handle and manage the errors gracefully. You can throw custom errors or handle specific error cases as needed.
          Once the comment has been successfully created, you can return a success message or the created comment itself.
          Here's a simplified example that demonstrates the process:
          
          async function getData() {
            let blogPost = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              setTimeout(() => {
                resolve("Blog Post");
              }, 2000);
            });
          
            let blogComment = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              setTimeout(() => {
                resolve("Comment For Blog");
              }, 5000);
            });
          
            console.log("Fetching Post....");
            let post = await blogPost;
            console.log("Post : ", post);
            console.log("Fetching Comment....");
            let comment = await blogComment;
            console.log("Comment : ", comment);
            return [post, comment];
          }
          
          console.log("Welcome to Blog Post");
          let data = getData();
          console.log(data);
          
          data
            .then((value) => {
              console.log(value);
            })
            .catch((err) => {
              console.log(err);
            });
            
          This code represents a simplified example of fetching blog post and comment data using async/await and Promises.
          
          The getData() function is defined as an async function. Inside it, two Promises are created, blogPost and blogComment, which simulate asynchronous operations that take some time to resolve.
          The blogPost Promise uses setTimeout to simulate a delay of 2 seconds before resolving with the value "Blog Post". Similarly, the blogComment Promise introduces a delay of 5 seconds before resolving with the value "Comment For Blog".
          The code then logs "Fetching Post...." to the console, indicating that the process of fetching the blog post has started.
          The await keyword is used to pause the execution of the getData() function until the blogPost Promise is resolved. The resolved value is assigned to the variable post.
          The code logs the value of the post variable, representing the fetched blog post, to the console.
          The code proceeds to log "Fetching Comment...." to indicate that it is now fetching the blog comment.
          Similarly, the await keyword is used to pause the execution until the blogComment Promise is resolved. The resolved value is assigned to the variable comment.
          The code logs the value of the comment variable, representing the fetched blog comment, to the console.
          Finally, the function returns an array [post, comment] containing both the blog post and comment.
          Outside the getData() function, "Welcome to Blog Post" is logged to the console.
          The getData() function is called and assigned to the variable data.
          The data variable is logged to the console. At this point, it is a pending Promise because the asynchronous operations inside getData() have not yet completed.
          The then() method is used to attach a callback function that will be executed when the data Promise is fulfilled. The resolved value is logged to the console.
          The catch() method is used to handle any errors that might occur during the Promise execution. If an error occurs, it is logged to the console.
          In summary, this code demonstrates the use of async/await to handle asynchronous operations with Promises. It simulates fetching a blog post and comment using artificial delays. The data is fetched sequentially, and the code ensures that the comments are fetched only after the blog post has been fetched.
          
          Calculating Result using Async/Await Functions
          Calculating Result using Async/Await Functions in JavaScript involves performing complex calculations, including arithmetic operations and utilizing math functions, in an asynchronous manner using the async/await syntax and Promises.
          
          The async/await syntax is a feature introduced in JavaScript to handle asynchronous code in a more sequential and synchronous-like manner. It allows you to write asynchronous operations in a more readable and structured way.
          
          To perform calculations asynchronously, you can define an async function that encapsulates the calculation logic. Within this function, you can use await to pause the execution until the asynchronous operations are completed.
          
          Here's a general outline of how you can approach calculating a result asynchronously using async/await:
          
          Define an async function, such as getResults, to encapsulate the calculation logic.
          Inside the function, perform the necessary calculations using arithmetic operations and math functions. You can use variables to store intermediate results.
          If there are any asynchronous operations involved, such as fetching data from an API or performing database queries, use await to pause the execution until those operations are completed. These asynchronous operations can be wrapped in Promises.
          Handle any errors that might occur during the asynchronous operations using try-catch blocks. This allows you to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
          Finally, return the calculated result from the function
          Here's a simplified example that demonstrates the concept:
          
          let result = function (marks) {
            return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
              console.log("Calculation Result....");
              setTimeout(() => {
                let total = 0;
                let result = "Pass";
                marks.forEach((mark) => {
                  total += mark;
                  <!-- if (mark < 35) { -->
                    result = "Fail";
                  }
                });
                resolve({ total: total, result: result });
              }, 2000);
            });
          };
          
          /*
          90-100 A
          80-89 B
          70-79 C
          <!-- 70 D //< -->
          */
          
          let grade = function (response) {
            return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
              if (response.result == "Pass") {
                let avg = response.total / 3;
                let gradeText = "Grade D";
                <!-- if (avg >= 90 && avg <= 100) { -->
                  gradeText = "Grade A";
                <!-- } else if (avg >= 80 && avg <= 89) { -->
                  gradeText = "Grade B";
                <!-- } else if (avg >= 70 && avg <= 79) { -->
                  gradeText = "Grade C";
                }
                resolve(gradeText);
              } else {
                reject("No Grade");
              }
            });
          };
          
          
          //then
          result([98, 99, 25])
            .then((value) => {
              console.log("Total  : ", value.total);
              console.log("Result : ", value.result);
              return grade(value);
            })
            .then((data) => {
              console.log(data);
            })
            .catch((err) => {
              console.error(err);
            });
            
            
            
          
          async function getResults() {
            try {
              const value = await result([98, 99, 55]);
              console.log("Total  : ", value.total);
              console.log("Result : ", value.result);
              const gradeText = await grade(value);
              console.log(gradeText);
            } catch (err) {
              console.error(err);
            }
          }
          
          getResults();
          This code demonstrates a scenario where the calculation of a student's result and grade is performed using Promises and async/await functions in JavaScript.
          
          The result function is defined, which takes an array of marks as input. It returns a Promise that performs a calculation based on the marks.
          Within the Promise, there is a setTimeout to simulate a delay of 2 seconds before the calculation is completed.
          The calculation involves iterating through the marks array, calculating the total, and determining the result as "Pass" or "Fail" based on a threshold of 35.
          Once the calculation is completed, the Promise is resolved with an object containing the total and result.
          The grade function is defined, which takes the response object from the previous step as input. It returns a Promise that calculates the grade based on the total.
          Within the Promise, if the result is "Pass", the average is calculated based on the total and the corresponding grade is determined.
          The Promise is then resolved with the grade.
          The code utilizes the then() method to chain the promises together. It calls the result function with a marks array and logs the total and result to the console.
          Then, it calls the grade function with the response and logs the grade text.
          If any errors occur during the promises' execution, they are caught and logged using the catch() method.
          The getResults async function is defined, which performs the same calculation using async/await syntax for better readability.
          Within the function, the result function is called with a marks array, and the total and result are logged to the console.
          The grade function is called with the response, and the grade text is logged.
          Any errors that occur during the execution are caught and logged using the try-catch block.
          Overall, this code demonstrates the calculation of a student's result and grade using Promises and async/await functions. It showcases how the async/await syntax can provide a more synchronous-like flow when dealing with asynchronous operations and how Promises can be chained together for handling sequential asynchronous tasks.

        <summary>Introduction to Fetch API in JavaScript: Making Asynchronous Network Requests
        </summary>
        <pre>
          The Fetch API is a JavaScript interface that provides a modern and powerful way to make asynchronous network requests in web browsers. It allows you to fetch resources from a server, such as JSON data, HTML pages, or binary files, and handle the response in a flexible manner.

Here are some key features and concepts related to the Fetch API:

Making Requests: The Fetch API uses the fetch() function to initiate HTTP requests. You pass in the URL of the resource you want to fetch, along with optional parameters to configure the request, such as request headers, request method (GET, POST, etc.), and request body.
Promises: Fetch API uses Promises to handle asynchronous operations. The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves to the response of the request. You can chain .then() and .catch() methods to handle the response and any errors that occur during the request.
Response Handling: Once you have the response, you can use methods like .json(), .text(), or .blob() to extract the content from the response in different formats. For example, .json() parses the response as JSON and returns a Promise that resolves to the parsed data.
Error Handling: The Fetch API considers network errors, status codes outside the range of 200-299, and other issues as rejected Promises. You can catch and handle these errors in the .catch() block of the Promise chain.
Cross-Origin Requests: Fetch API supports making cross-origin requests, meaning you can fetch resources from a different domain or origin. However, you might encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions depending on the server's configuration.
Fetch Headers: You can set custom headers in the request to provide additional information to the server or to handle authentication. Headers like Content-Type, Authorization, or custom headers can be added to the request using the Headers object.
The Fetch API is widely supported in modern browsers and is considered a more modern alternative to older techniques like XMLHttpRequest. It offers a cleaner and more intuitive syntax for handling asynchronous requests and responses.

It's important to note that the Fetch API uses the underlying network capabilities of the browser, so it supports the same security considerations as other web-based HTTP requests. Additionally, since the Fetch API relies on Promises, it can be used effectively with modern JavaScript features like async/await for more concise and readable code.

fetch_api.js
This code snippet demonstrates different examples of using the Fetch API in JavaScript to fetch data from various sources, handle the responses, and update the HTML content. Let's break it down section by section:

Text File Fetch:

const btnText = document.querySelector("#btn-text");
const outputText = document.querySelector("#txt-output");

btnText.addEventListener("click", getTextFile);

function getTextFile() {
  fetch("data.txt")
    .then((res) => res.text())
    .then((data) => {
      outputText.innerHTML = data;
    });
}
In this section, there is a button with the ID "btn-text" and an output element with the ID "txt-output". The getTextFile function is registered as the click event listener for the button. When the button is clicked, it triggers the function.

Inside getTextFile, the fetch function is used to fetch the "data.txt" file. The response is received as a Response object, and the .text() method is called on it to extract the text content of the response. This returns a Promise that resolves to the text data.

In the next .then() block, the text data is received as the data parameter. The HTML content of the output element is updated with the received data.

JSON File Fetch:

const btnJson = document.querySelector("#btn-json");
const outputJson = document.querySelector("#json-output");

btnJson.addEventListener("click", getJsonData);

function getJsonData() {
  fetch("users.json")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((users) => {
      let data = " ul>";
      users.forEach((user) => {
        data += ` li>${user.name} : ${user.age} /li>`;
      });
      data += " /ul>";
      outputJson.innerHTML = data;
    });
}
This section is similar to the previous one but fetches a JSON file ("users.json") instead. The response is parsed as JSON using the .json() method, which returns a Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.

In the subsequent .then() block, the JSON data is received as the users parameter. It loops over each user and constructs an HTML string to display the user's name and age in a list (<ul>). The HTML content of the output element is then updated with the generated data.

API Data Fetch:

const btnApi = document.querySelector("#btn-api");
const outputApi = document.querySelector("#api-output");

btnApi.addEventListener("click", getApiData);

async function getApiData() {
  const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
  const jsonData = await response.json();
  let output = "";
  jsonData.forEach((post) => {
    output += `div class='post'>
            h4>${post.title} /h4>
            p>${post.body} /p>
      div>`;
  });

  outputApi.innerHTML = output;
}
In this section, a button with the ID "btn-api" and an output element with the ID "api-output" are defined. The getApiData function is registered as the click event listener for the button.

Inside getApiData, an asynchronous function is declared using the async keyword. It fetches data from the "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" URL, which represents a JSON API endpoint. The response is obtained using await and then parsed as JSON using .json().

Once the JSON data is received as jsonData, a loop iterates over each post and constructs an HTML string representing a post's title and body. The generated HTML is appended to the output variable.

Finally, the HTML content of the output element is updated with the output string, displaying the posts in a styled format.

Console Output:

console.log("Start");

function hello() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}

console.log("end");

console.log("Start");
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function callback() {
  console.log("Hello World");
});
console.log("end");
In this part, console log statements are used to output messages in the browser's console.

The statements console.log("Start"); and console.log("end"); will log the corresponding messages in the console.

The hello function is defined but not invoked, so it won't log anything unless explicitly called.

The final block sets up an event listener for a button with the ID "btn". When the button is clicked, the anonymous callback function logs "Hello World" in the console.

Overall, this code demonstrates fetching data from text files, JSON files, and a remote API using the Fetch API. The fetched data is then used to update the content of specific HTML elements. Additionally, there are console log statements to demonstrate logging messages at different stages of the code execution.

data.txt
This is sample text from data.txt
users.json
The provided data is an array of four objects, each representing information about a person. Let's break down the structure and the properties of each object:

[
  {
    "name": "Tiya",
    "age": 25,
    "gender": "Male",
    "contact": 7859586895,
    "isMarried": false,
    "city": "Salem"
  },
  {
    "name": "Ram",
    "age": 32,
    "gender": "Male",
    "contact": 859658585,
    "isMarried": true,
    "city": "Chennai"
  },
  {
    "name": "Sara",
    "age": 18,
    "gender": "Female",
    "contact": 8596857585,
    "isMarried": false,
    "city": "Salem"
  },
  {
    "name": "Sam",
    "age": 24,
    "gender": "Male",
    "contact": 856968575,
    "isMarried": true,
    "city": "Chennai"
  }
]
Each object represents a person's information and contains properties such as name, age, gender, contact number, marital status, and city.

For example, in the first object, "Tiya" is a 25-year-old male from Salem. The isMarried property is set to false, indicating that Tiya is not married. The contact number is 7859586895.

Similarly, the other objects represent individuals with their respective information.

This data can be useful for various purposes, such as displaying a list of people, filtering based on certain criteria, or performing data analysis.

        <summary>Understanding the Event Loop in JavaScript: Asynchronous Execution Made Simple</summary>
        <pre>
          The event loop is a fundamental mechanism in JavaScript that enables asynchronous behavior and ensures smooth execution of code without blocking the main thread. It is at the core of JavaScript's concurrency model and plays a crucial role in handling events, executing callbacks, and managing asynchronous operations.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the event loop works in JavaScript:

Execution Stack: When JavaScript code is executed, it maintains a stack called the execution stack. It keeps track of the currently running function or task.
Task Queue: Alongside the execution stack, there is a task queue, also known as the callback queue or message queue. It holds tasks or events that are ready to be processed. These tasks can include timers, network requests, user interactions, and other asynchronous operations.
Event-Driven Architecture: JavaScript is designed as an event-driven language. Events can be triggered by various sources, such as user actions (e.g., clicks), timers, or network responses. When an event occurs, a corresponding callback function (also known as an event handler) is generated and placed in the task queue.
Event Loop: The event loop is a continuous process that checks two main entities the execution stack and the task queue.
Event Loop Process:
If the execution stack is empty and there are tasks in the task queue, the event loop moves the tasks from the task queue to the execution stack, starting with the oldest task.
The task in the execution stack is processed, and its associated function is executed.
While executing the function, if additional asynchronous tasks are encountered (e.g., AJAX requests or setTimeout), they are registered, and their corresponding callbacks are placed in the task queue.
Once the function execution is complete, it is removed from the execution stack.
The event loop repeats the process by checking the execution stack and the task queue.
Non-Blocking Nature: The event loop ensures that JavaScript remains non-blocking. This means that while asynchronous operations are being performed, the main thread is free to handle other tasks or respond to user interactions without waiting for the completion of those asynchronous tasks.
By leveraging the event loop, JavaScript can efficiently handle concurrency, process asynchronous operations, and create responsive web applications. Understanding how the event loop works is crucial for writing efficient and per formant JavaScript code.

Global Execution Context
Global Execution Context
The global execution context is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that represents the environment in which the global JavaScript code is executed. It is created automatically when a JavaScript program starts running and serves as the initial context for executing the code.

Here are some key points to understand about the global execution context:

Creation: When a JavaScript program begins execution, the global execution context is created. It consists of two main components: the global object and the this value.
Global Object: The global object serves as the global scope in JavaScript. In a web browser environment, the global object is typically the window object. It provides access to various properties and methods that are available globally, such as console, setTimeout, Math, and more.
Global Scope: The global execution context establishes the global scope, which is the outermost scope in JavaScript. Variables and functions declared outside of any function are placed in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere within the code.
this Value: The this value in the global execution context refers to the global object. In a web browser, this inside the global context points to the window object.
Hoisting: During the creation of the global execution context, JavaScript hoists variable declarations and function declarations to the top of their respective scopes. This means that regardless of where variables and functions are declared in the code, they are conceptually moved to the top of the global scope.
Execution: Once the global execution context is created, JavaScript starts executing the code line by line, following the order of statements. As the code executes, variables are initialized, functions are registered, and executable code is run.
Global Variables and Functions: Variables and functions declared in the global scope are accessible from any part of the codebase, including nested functions or other execution contexts.
Global Execution Context and Function Execution Contexts: Whenever a function is invoked, a new function execution context is created and added to the execution stack. These function execution contexts have their own variable environments and are nested within the global execution context.
Understanding the global execution context is crucial for comprehending how JavaScript manages variables, functions, and scope throughout the code execution process. It sets the foundation for the creation of other execution contexts and plays a vital role in scoping and variable access within a JavaScript program.

Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols provided by web browsers to enable web developers to interact with various web browser features and functionality. These APIs allow developers to access and manipulate web browser capabilities, interact with web content, handle events, perform network requests, store and retrieve data, and much more. Web APIs provide a way for web applications to interact with the underlying browser environment and extend the capabilities of web development.

setTimeout Function
In JavaScript, the setTimeout() function is a built-in method that allows you to schedule the execution of a function or the evaluation of an expression after a specified delay. It is commonly used for adding delays, creating timed animations, implementing timeouts, or executing code asynchronously.

The syntax for the setTimeout() function is as follows:

setTimeout(callback, delay, param1, param2, ...)
Here's a breakdown of the different parts of the setTimeout() function:

callback: This parameter represents the function or the code to be executed after the delay. It can be provided as a function reference or an inline function declaration.
delay: This parameter specifies the time delay (in milliseconds) before the execution of the callback function. It indicates how long the JavaScript engine should wait before invoking the callback.
param1, param2, ...: These optional parameters allow you to pass additional arguments to the callback function if needed. They are passed as arguments to the callback when it is executed.
When setTimeout() is called, it initiates a timer that counts down the specified delay. Once the delay has elapsed, the JavaScript engine places the callback function in the event queue, making it ready for execution. The execution of the callback occurs when the call stack is empty and the event loop checks the event queue.

setTimeOut
Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of setTimeout():

console.log("Start");
 setTimeout (function callback() {   
    console.log("Hello World");
 },5000); 
console.log("end"); 
The setTimeout() function is called with two parameters:

The first parameter is an anonymous callback function: function callback() { console.log("Hello World"); }. This function will be executed after a delay of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).
The second parameter is the delay specified in milliseconds (5000 in this case).
The important thing to note here is that even though the setTimeout() function is called before the console.log("end"); statement, the callback function inside setTimeout() is not executed immediately. Instead, it is scheduled to run after the specified delay. In the meantime, the code continues executing without waiting for the delay to complete. This behavior is what allows asynchronous execution in JavaScript.

So, the output shows that "Hello World" is printed after the delay of 5 seconds, following the "Start" and "end" messages.

The setTimeout() function is a powerful tool for managing delays and executing code asynchronously in JavaScript. It provides a way to introduce time-based behavior into your applications and perform actions after a specific duration.

addEventListener Function
In JavaScript, the addEventListener() method is used to attach an event listener to an HTML element or an object. It allows you to listen for specific events and execute a callback function when those events occur. The addEventListener() method provides a way to handle various user interactions and respond to events in a flexible and modular manner.

The syntax for addEventListener() is as follows:

element.addEventListener(event, callback, options);
Here's an explanation of the different parts of the addEventListener() method:

element: This is a reference to the HTML element or object to which you want to attach the event listener.
event: The event parameter represents the name of the event you want to listen for. It can be a built-in event such as "click," "mouseover," "keydown," or a custom event.
callback: The callback function is the function that will be executed when the specified event occurs. It can be an anonymous function or a named function.
options (optional): The options parameter is an optional object that specifies additional options for the event listener, such as capturing or once behaviour. It is an object with properties like capture and once.
When an event occurs on the specified element, the callback function associated with the event listener is invoked. The callback function typically takes an event object as a parameter, which contains information about the event, such as the event type, target element, and other related data.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of addEventListener() :

console.log("Start");
document.getElementById("btn")
.addEventListener("click",function callback() {   
    console.log("Hello World");
 }); 
console.log("end"); 
The event listener is defined as an anonymous callback function: function callback() { console.log("Hello World"); }. This function will be executed when the "click" event occurs on the specified element.

The code demonstrates how to attach an event listener to an HTML element using addEventListener(). In this case, it attaches a "click" event listener to an element with the id "btn". However, without an actual click event occurring on that element, the callback function is not executed.

If you want to see the "Hello World" message being printed, ensure that there is an HTML element with the id "btn" and simulate a click event on that element. For example, you can add an HTML button with id="btn" and manually click on it to trigger the event listener.

By utilizing addEventListener(), you can create interactive and responsive web applications by handling user interactions and other events effectively.

Micro Task Queue
In JavaScript, the Micro Task Queue, also known as the Job Queue or Promise Jobs, is a component of the JavaScript event loop that handles the execution of micro tasks. It is a queue that holds tasks that are scheduled to run after the current task but before the rendering of the UI.

Micro tasks are a category of tasks that have higher priority and are executed asynchronously. They include tasks such as Promise callbacks (then, catch, finally), MutationObserver callbacks, and some parts of the ECMAScript specification, like process.nextTick in Node.js.

Micro Task

When a micro task is scheduled for execution, it is added to the Micro Task Queue.
After the current task in the call stack completes, the JavaScript event loop checks if there are any tasks in the Micro Task Queue.
If the Micro Task Queue is not empty, the event loop starts executing the tasks one by one, in the order they were added. Each task is run to completion before moving on to the next task.
While executing the micro tasks, the event loop does not perform any rendering updates. This means that micro tasks can delay rendering and other visual updates on the page.
After all the micro tasks are completed, the event loop checks if there are any pending rendering updates or other tasks in the task queue. If there are, it proceeds to execute the next task in the Task Queue.
This process of alternating between the Micro Task Queue and the Task Queue continues as long as there are tasks to execute.
The Micro Task Queue has a higher priority compared to the Task Queue, which contains tasks such as event callbacks (e.g., setTimeout, setInterval) and I/O operations. The event loop ensures that micro tasks are executed immediately after the current task, allowing for more fine-grained control over asynchronous operations and better responsiveness in certain scenarios.

In summary, the Micro Task Queue is a specialized queue in the JavaScript event loop that handles the execution of micro tasks. It ensures the asynchronous execution of tasks with higher priority, such as Promise callbacks, before other tasks and rendering updates take place.

        <summary>Event Bubbling in JavaScript: Understanding Event Propagation</summary>
        <pre>
          Event bubbling is a mechanism in JavaScript where an event triggered on an element is propagated or "bubbles up" through its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy. It follows the natural hierarchy of the DOM, starting from the target element and moving up towards the topmost parent element.

When an event is triggered on an element, such as a click event, it goes through two phases: capturing and bubbling. In the capturing phase, the event starts from the topmost parent element (usually the <html> element) and traverses down to the target element. After the capturing phase, the event enters the bubbling phase, where it triggers on the target element and then propagates up through its parent elements.

During the bubbling phase, the event triggers on each parent element in the DOM hierarchy, which means that you can also attach event listeners to the parent or any ancestor elements to listen for the same event.

Event bubbling is the default behavior in most modern browsers, and it allows for convenient event handling. It enables you to listen for events on a parent element and handle events from multiple child elements within it. This approach is particularly useful when you have a list or a group of elements where you want to apply the same event handling logic without attaching individual event listeners to each child element.

Event delegation, as explained earlier, takes advantage of event bubbling by attaching an event listener to a parent element and utilizing the bubbling phase to handle events on its child elements.

</html> -->
event_bub.js
This code demonstrates event handling using event bubbling and event capturing phases in JavaScript. Let's go through the code and understand its behavior.

const grandparent = document.querySelector("#grandparent");
const parent = document.querySelector("#parent");
const child = document.querySelector("#child");
Here, three elements with IDs "grandparent," "parent," and "child" are selected from the DOM and stored in variables.

grandparent.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Grandparent Clicked");
}, true);
An event listener is attached to the grandparent element with the "click" event. The listener function logs "Grandparent Clicked" to the console. The third argument, true, indicates that the listener is registered for the capturing phase.

parent.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Parent Clicked");
}, false);
An event listener is attached to the parent element with the "click" event. The listener function logs "Parent Clicked" to the console. The third argument, false, indicates that the listener is registered for the bubbling phase.

child.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  console.log("Child Clicked");
  e.stopImmediatePropagation();
}, true);
An event listener is attached to the child element with the "click" event. The listener function logs "Child Clicked" to the console. The third argument, true, indicates that the listener is registered for the capturing phase. Additionally, e.stopImmediatePropagation() is called to prevent further propagation of the event to other elements.

child.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  console.log("Child Clicked2");
}, true);
Another event listener is attached to the child element with the "click" event. The listener function logs "Child Clicked2" to the console. The third argument, true, indicates that the listener is registered for the capturing phase.

In this code, event listeners are registered on the grandparent, parent, and child elements with different capturing/bubbling configurations. By clicking on different elements, you can observe the order of event execution based on the capturing and bubbling phases.

Based on the current commented configuration, the order of events logged would be:

Grandparent Clicked (capturing phase)
Parent Clicked (capturing phase)
Child Clicked (capturing phase)
Child Clicked2 (capturing phase)
However, if you uncomment the final configuration where e.stopImmediatePropagation() is used, only "Child Clicked" will be logged, and "Child Clicked2" won't be logged due to immediate propagation stoppage.

The behavior of event bubbling and capturing allows you to handle events on different elements and control the flow of event propagation in the DOM hierarchy.

        e.stopPropagation();
        console.log("Input Click");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html> -->
This code demonstrates a simple modal behavior with event handling in JavaScript. Let's go through the code and understand its functionality.

const btnModal = document.querySelector("#btnModal");
const modal = document.querySelector("#modal");
const btnSubmit = document.querySelector("#btnSubmit");
const txtName = document.querySelector("#txtName");
Here, elements with IDs "btnModal," "modal," "btnSubmit," and "txtName" are selected from the DOM and stored in variables.

btnModal.addEventListener("click", function () {
  modal.style.display = "flex";
});
An event listener is attached to the btnModal element with the "click" event. When the button is clicked, the listener function is triggered, and it sets the display property of the modal element to "flex", making the modal visible.

modal.addEventListener("click", function () {
  modal.style.display = "none";
});
An event listener is attached to the modal element with the "click" event. When the modal is clicked, the listener function is triggered, and it sets the display property of the modal element to "none", hiding the modal.

btnSubmit.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  e.stopPropagation();
  console.log("Submit button Pressed");
});
An event listener is attached to the btnSubmit element with the "click" event. When the submit button is clicked, the listener function is triggered, and it logs "Submit button Pressed" to the console. Additionally, e.stopPropagation() is called to prevent further propagation of the event, ensuring that the modal doesn't close when clicking on the submit button.

txtName.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  e.stopPropagation();
  console.log("Input Click");
});
An event listener is attached to the txtName element with the "click" event. When the input field is clicked, the listener function is triggered, and it logs "Input Click" to the console. Similarly, e.stopPropagation() is called to prevent further propagation of the event.

In summary, this code sets up a modal behavior where clicking the "Open Modal" button displays the modal, and clicking anywhere outside the modal closes it. The submit button and input field inside the modal have event listeners with e.stopPropagation() to prevent the modal from closing when interacting with them.

The code showcases how event handling can be used to control the behavior of a modal and capture specific actions within the modal without affecting the overall modal functionality.

        <summary>Event Delegation in JavaScript: Efficient Event Handling for Dynamic Elements</summary>
        <pre>
          
Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to handle events on parent elements rather than directly attaching event listeners to individual child elements. With event delegation, you can efficiently manage events for dynamically added or removed elements within a container.

The concept behind event delegation is based on event propagation, which includes two phases: capturing and bubbling. When an event occurs on a DOM element, it first goes through the capturing phase, where the event is triggered on the parent elements starting from the top of the DOM hierarchy and moving towards the target element. After the capturing phase, the event enters the bubbling phase, where it triggers on the target element and then propagates up through the parent elements.

Event delegation takes advantage of event bubbling. Instead of attaching an event listener to each individual child element, you attach a single event listener to the parent element. When an event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up to the parent element and triggers the event listener attached to the parent. The parent element then determines which child element triggered the event by inspecting the event.target property.

The main advantages of event delegation are:
Efficiency: With event delegation, you can handle events for a large number of elements efficiently, as you only need to attach a single event listener on the parent element rather than multiple listeners on each child element. This is especially useful when dealing with dynamically added or removed elements.
Dynamic Element Handling: Event delegation allows you to handle events on dynamically added or removed elements without the need to attach and detach event listeners manually. The parent element remains constant, so it can handle events even for elements that are added or removed dynamically.
Simplified Code: By using event delegation, you can write cleaner and more concise code by avoiding the need to attach event listeners to each individual element. This leads to better code maintainability and reduces the chances of memory leaks due to forgotten or orphaned event listeners.

const catagories = document.getElementById("categories");

catagories.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  //console.log(e.target);
  if (e.target.className == "product") {
    //console.log(e.target.id);
    window.location.href = "/" + e.target.id;
  }
});
This code snippet demonstrates an event listener that handles a click event on an element with the ID "categories". Let's break it down step by step:

const catagories = document.getElementById("categories");
This line fetches the DOM element with the ID "categories" and assigns it to the variable catagories. It assumes there is an HTML element with the ID "categories" in the document.

catagories.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  // Code to execute when the click event occurs
});
The addEventListener() method is called on the catagories element to attach a click event listener to it. The event listener will be triggered when a click event happens on the element.

The provided function (e) => {...} is the event handler that will be executed when the click event occurs. The e parameter represents the event object, which contains information about the event.
if (e.target.className == "product") {
  // Code to execute if the clicked element has the class "product"
}
Inside the event handler, this if statement checks if the element that triggered the click event has a CSS class name equal to "product". This is done by accessing the className property of the e.target element, which represents the actual element that was clicked.

If the condition is true, it means the clicked element has the class "product", and the code inside the if block will be executed.

window.location.href = "/" + e.target.id;
This line sets the window.location.href property to a new URL. It concatenates "/" with the id property of the clicked element (e.target.id). The resulting URL will navigate the user to a new page, using the value of the clicked element's ID as part of the URL path.

In summary, this code listens for click events on the "categories" element. If the clicked element has the class "product", it retrieves its ID and redirects the user to a new page using that ID as part of the URL path.

const frm = document.getElementById("frm");

frm.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
  if (e.target.dataset.uppercase != undefined) {
    e.target.value = e.target.value.toUpperCase();
  }
});
This code snippet demonstrates an event listener that handles the "keyup" event on a form element with the ID "frm". Here's a breakdown of how it works:

const frm = document.getElementById("frm");
This line fetches the form element with the ID "frm" from the DOM and assigns it to the variable frm. It assumes there is an HTML form element with the ID "frm" in the document.

frm.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
  // Code to execute when the keyup event occurs
});
The addEventListener() method is called on the frm form element to attach a "keyup" event listener to it. The event listener will be triggered when a key is released after being pressed within the form element.

The provided arrow function (e) => {...} is the event handler that will be executed when the keyup event occurs. The e parameter represents the event object, which contains information about the event.

if (e.target.dataset.uppercase != undefined) {
  e.target.value = e.target.value.toUpperCase();
}
Inside the event handler, this if statement checks if the element that triggered the keyup event has a "data-uppercase" attribute. It uses the dataset property of the e.target element to access custom data attributes.

If the condition is true, it means the element has the "data-uppercase" attribute, indicating that the value entered in the form element should be converted to uppercase. In that case, the line e.target.value = e.target.value.toUpperCase(); sets the value of the form element to its uppercase version.

In summary, this code listens for keyup events within the "frm" form element. If the element has a "data-uppercase" attribute, it automatically converts the entered value to uppercase. This functionality can be useful for enforcing uppercase input in specific form fields.

To implement event delegation, you attach an event listener to the parent element and use conditional statements to determine which child element triggered the event based on the event.target. You can then perform the desired actions or event handling logic accordingly.

Event delegation is commonly used in scenarios where you have a list or a container with multiple elements that require similar event handling, such as a dynamic list of items, a table, or a menu. It provides a scalable and efficient approach to handling events in these situations.

        <summary>Debouncing Method in JavaScript
        </summary>
        <pre>
          In JavaScript, a debounce function makes sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks are all use cases for debounce.

Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance. There might be some functionality in a web page that requires time-consuming computations. If such a method is invoked frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as JavaScript is a single-threaded language.

A Debounce function is a higher-order function that returns another function, to create closure around the function parameters (func, timeout) and the timer variable.

func: is a function that you want to execute after the debounce time
timeout: The amount of time you want the debounce function to wait after the last received action before executing func.
timer: The value used to indicate a running debounce.
